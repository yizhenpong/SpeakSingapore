speaker,speech
A,I think we better start okay won't wait for Boon Lai okay
A,Shan't ask you about the question one where you're supposed to give me examples but tell me why uhm people say that spelling is inconsistent for example what do they mean
B,You can have uhm two sounds representing more than one sound represent representing one uh letter
A,Represent or is it the other way round
B,One letter can represent more than one sound ya
A,Okay for example
B,Like uhm uhm uhm car and uh treat and uh hit
C,Hate hat all using ah
A,The ah okay
C,<unclear> word </unclear>
A,Ser Suan any examples
D,<unclear> word </unclear> Country aspect
A,How
D,Okay
A,Country and smack
D,Uh which one are you doing *laughs*
A,We're talking about how spelling can be inconsistent right and then uhm and then we say that it is inconsistent because we have one symbol representing several sounds so we've been we need examples for different symbols
D,Symbol as in a phonetic symbol
A,Uhm spelling right
D,Spelling symbol uhm sleigh and sleight
A,Sleight which sleight
D,S L E I G H T
A,Is that slight or sleight
A,Whatever
D,Slight sorry *laughs*
A,Okay what about uneconomical
A,What do they mean
E,<unclear> word </unclear> it means a lot of letters take up a lot of space *laughs*
A,A lot of letters for what to
E,To spell a word
A,A word
B,A syllable
A,Or sound a syllable a sound for example
E,But think it is a Ch that's if we pronounce it as cher but uhm you need two letters to represent it
E,In phonetics only one symbol
A,Uhm not our phonetics though the American one right
E,Ya
A,Okay okay now if people think that spelling can be inconsistent and uneconomical etcetera what assumptions are they making about the relationship between spelling and speech
A,Question two
B,They're assuming that like uhm pronunci uhm spelling must reflect pronunciation and it represents it must represent the spelling must represent the sound of a the spelling of a word must represent the sound of a word
A,Okay so it's like spelling should be phonological right okay so one letter should represent one sound
A,Now why did people have this assumption
A,What gave them the idea that oh when you write you should ex exactly represent how you speak
A,What are the different explanations for this assumption
A,Boon Leng
C,Uh I think in the past they they always think that language has everything to do with writing so they always consider that writing is a I mean a a bit I think they're trying to reverse the <unclear> word </unclear> slowly
C,I think it's an over-correction now
A,Ah what does what does over-correction mean
C,That means to say uh they they do correct these false notion to a to a very extreme degree
A,Okay so instead of saying that now we should raise the standard of ah speech to the standard of writing make them equal they actually make it even more important
A,So now they're saying the other way uh the other thing that writing should represent speech
C,Ya
A,Okay what other explanations so you have besides over-correction
C,Uh they also because in the last in the past when they uh when they were learning how to read and write they they were using uhm I mean the students actually have to pronounce the word so for them uhm the words I mean ah they equate them with uh <unclear> word </unclear>
C,So uh but because the the kind of education uh system that we have nowadays is that we just look at the word and the word forms a mental impression on our heads so because the system is different I should think that uhm whoever is uh formulating this assumption must have got it from his ah learning experiences
A,Uhm uhm okay so the old habits of reading and writing affected their view of what spelling should be
A,Then one more thing about maybe they saw a very close connection between writing and speech and therefore they assume that it must be exactly the same
A,What sort of close connection do they see between writing and speech
A,Soh Suan
E,Uhm because <unclear> word </unclear> they use symbols to represent the word I mean the character which they are describing
A,And what do you mean by symbols
A,If we say symbols we can say the traffic sign STOP is a symbol so writing is not like a traffic sign right
A,What's so special about writing
C,Uhm writing has only one particular spoken symbol attached to it so in a way it's a very close link you see because the traffic signs they I mean you can see them for what they for what they mean but you cannot utter anything about them
A,Okay and also different countries can use the same sign but they can say that that sign is stop sign that sign is a sign for uh for vehicles to ting xia lai which is Mandarin and all that right
A,So what about the character ren that you saw
A,Well what about all the Chinese languages
A,Do they pronounce it in different ways
C,They do they do
A,But how come your characters' the same
C,Uhm
A,*laughs* So Chinese languages is uhm special example right it's a special example okay
A,So if you think of STOP maybe S T O P if an Indian came along he can't pronounce STOP in Tamil I mean the S T O P right or he can't a Chinese can't say anything right when he sees S T O P so in that way maybe they saw the close connection between writing and speech
A,Hello *laughs*
A,Okay then let's go on to question four okay
A,When we were we were saying that people have uh wrong assumptions about what the relationship between writing and spelling it's okay
A,One thing was that they over-corrected their idea that now speech should be very important and language should written language should reflect speech
A,Another thing was that they saw a very close connection between speech and writing and so they assume therefore that they must be exactly the same okay
A,So if we think that such views are wrong how do you think you can express the relationship better the relationship between speech and writing
E,Under true functions
A,Sorry
E,They've close connection but ah they have speech and writing as different functions and they occur in different contact
A,Right so can you give examples of that different functions etcetra
E,Uh speech has uhm paralinguistic function but uh writing doesn't have
A,For example
A,What do you mean
A,Paralinguistic features
E,Uhm their gestures their facial expressions ah but you cannot uhm put that into writing
A,Okay that's one
A,What else
A,Choon Kiat
B,Uh speech most of the time it'll be uhm spontaneous whereas for writing it'll it'll be more of a pre-planned thing so you can phrase whatever you want to say whatever you put down on paper beforehand for writing a a speech
A,Okay
B,And uh there'll be pauses as well for speech it won't be such a smooth flow as as writing
B,Basically writing would be for more formal context where where speech is more of a social sort of a context
A,Okay any other points
A,Boon Lai have you caught your breath yet *laughs*
A,Do you have any points
F,Uh just that writing develop because of a need for record
A,Right
F,Which speech could not do
A,Why not
F,Uhm speech is limited by memory and ya writing is not writing can be passed down to future generations
A,Okay so writing can be permanent and speech is transient
A,What else
C,Uhm there is the distance factor between speech is limited by the range of voice but writing you know I mean is not it have it can travel greater distances
A,Okay that's not taking uh technology into account right because like people can say oh but we can call people
C,Oh ya
A,And all that okay alright then Five A
A,What are the two major sets of principles from which spelling system of English is based
F,Is it etymology right and
A,And
F,And phonology
B,Phonology
F,Phonology
A,Okay so what about isomological
C,The basis of uh the the the source of which the rest comes from dictionary uh so the the I think the dictionary makers they the dictionary wri the writers they they try to insofar as possible to trace the uh uh the etym the the root the word the etymological roots and uh as close a representation as possible
A,Okay so one thing is that it the spelling of the word need not be the Latin form or the French form but then because they were concerned about showing etymology so they thought they should reflect in the spelling the source of which the word was borrowed okay
A,So you have examples like island where initially there was no 's' right but they thought that it came from insular so they added the 's'
A,But what about other uhm reasons for etymological spellings
A,Need it be a deliberate attempt
F,Are you are you talking about democratic nature that Johnson fixed it etymologically because he could not decide on which one to use so it's like
A,Who did he follow then
F,He followed conservative right
F,So Uhm conservative means it's not <unclear> word </unclear> it's not a regional variation of English so he he went back to the past
A,Okay uhm what about the very fact of borrowing a word from Latin or French
A,Once you borrow you do you spell it your own way or do you spell it their way
D,They anglicise it
D,It's not the the their own way modified their spelling
A,Ah Latin words
A,Okay what about French words like beauty cigarette
A,When you see the 'ette' you know immediately it's not English it's French right do you *laughs*
A,Intuitively maybe hopefully anyway so what about that
A,It's not deliberate right
A,They didn't say that oh we want to reflect in our language that cigarette came from French but it's just immediate borrowing right
A,Okay so there are different explanations for etymological spellings
A,What about phonological
A,How did that start
F,Uhm are you referring to ah older words which were words which were spelt in a way which was pronounced in the past like for example I think psychology was the p-s was was pronounced in the past right
F,Was it
A,Was it
F,Was it somebody words
F,*laughs*
A,What's the point then if that is the case
F,I believe it's not to confuse people right like you ah it's been around for so long
A,Oh so you don't eliminate the p
B,But what I thought about phonological is like to reflect an image of sound
A,Ya
B,They want the the spelling to be an image of that sound
A,Right so the point that he was trying to say is that even though now we don't pronounce persychology *laughs*
A,In the past maybe they did but I think the 'k-n' one know ya they might have pronounced 'k-n' and then we stop pronouncing the 'ker' or something like that okay but then the spellings do show the previous phonological system
A,Okay but phonological system means that they tried to have a letter for a particular sound right and to reflect pronunciation
A,So how did that start
A,At the very beginning they didn't have alphabets right
A,What did they have in old English time
A,The runic system
C,The runic system
A,Then who brought the alphabet
F,Romans Romans
C,Romans Christianity and
A,Christianity
F,Christianity
A,So the scribes started using the Roman alphabet then you think the Roman alphabet would of course be used for which language
C,Latin
A,So is the sound system of Latin like Old English
F,No
A,Of course not
A,So they must adapt a spelling system which is for another language into their own Old English
A,Then what happened What are the problems that arise
A,Tracy
E,The uhm the Old English sounds didn't match the Latin sounds
A,So what did they do
E,They borrowed the runic letters
A,They borrowed runic <X>
E,Runic runic letters
A,Ya right that's one way
E,And the introduce the <unclear> word </unclear> combination
A,Okay and what about the next page
A,*laughs* </X> </I>
