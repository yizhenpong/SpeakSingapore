speaker,speech
A,You've got a minute
B,Sure
A,Oh
B,What do you want to talk about
A,Oh that's I just was wondering whether we could discuss our projects so we know what we are all doing
B,Okay why don't you go ahead first
A,Uhm I am trying to figure out something to do for my dissertation
B,I thought you already had your health promotion project in mind
A,Ya ya but I need to find out what exactly I want to do with it
B,What about the uh the company that had approached you
A,<unclear> word </unclear>
B,Is it <unclear> word </unclear>
B,No the one that uh I was working with Kai Hong and the big one that uh the boss was involved in
A,Is it that one that students lead the project uh
B,No
A,Uhm
B,The one you said was your going to be your main focus for the next year
A,Oh that's a Johnson and Johnson company
B,Ah
A,Uh I don't know but that one is still tentative
A,Can't wait that long
B,What are they going to do
A,They want to start this healthy lifestyle thing which they've got bought <unclear> word </unclear> it from Johnson and Johnson and uh might be a bit difficult to get in uh
A,Too big and then they're starting off
A,Uh it seems to be a lot of strings attached so it may not be such a good idea at this point in time
A,May not be able to get it ready by my dissertation time
A,So thinking of NatSteel
A,NatSteel is good because the management is very supportive but there's a problem
B,What's their that problem
A,NatSteel is not a typical uh typical company
A,I mean it's it's a very heavy industry
A,It's only iron and steel mill we have and then the turnover is shockingly low
A,It's about
A,How much
A,Less than four percent
B,But that's good
A,No that's bad because I can't extrapolate you see
A,Uh on the one hand it's good for my for my project study
B,Uhm
A,It's bad because at the end of it I can't really I can't really extrapolate and say this is what other companies would have unless you first say that it should uh have a better turnover
A,And then the population are older because they don't they don't resign
A,So it's an older population
A,Whoa the average age is about forty years old
A,Then companies like AT & T is about twentish and then turnover is about thirty-five percent there
A,And these are the majority that's your typical company
A,Then if I take one like that and I have a high turnover I can't do anything either
A,Problem
B,Well but are there a group of companies with a low turnover like NatSteel
A,As far as I know very few
B,And and an older population
B,So it's it's the exception uh that that seems to be
A,Seems to be
A,Finance Steel is is a very good place to do a control study
A,They've got the structure for it
A,I think I just going ahead
B,I mean it's for your dissertation
A,Ya
A,Unless I finish it
B,Uh you can just
A,Before July
B,Ya
B,And then later on if you want to do a bigger one that you can extrapolate you can do it after the course
A,Correct
A,Sounds good
A,What about yourself
B,Well
B,I've got all the data
B,Uh and I've done most of the sub <unclear> word </unclear> about half the analysis and I've <unclear> word </unclear> up the literature review
B,Then I am going to do the results
B,But I've to do it I hope to get the first draft out by July because I understand that once the course starts there's very little time to do the dissertation
B,I pity the the people who come with no data and have to actually go and start doing their survey from scratch because they really have to struggle what with studying and doing the project at the same time
A,I think there're very few of these
A,They seem to know
A,Those who come
A,Most of them come with their <unclear> word </unclear>
B,Ya
B,Most of them do
A,Unless it's a one-year thing
A,So at the end of it you've got three months
B,No it's nine months for me
B,It's nine it's still nine months this year
A,Uh
B,Ya
A,Oh
B,From next year it's one year
A,Oh you can always wait
B,But it doesn't matter because the last three months are only for your dissertation
A,Optional ya
B,Ya
A,Uhm
A,Yours is cervical
B,Cervical cancer screening
A,Screening screening
B,Pep smear
A,What do you find anyway
B,I found that fifty-four point four percent of women in Pasir Panjang GRC have had a pep smear
A,How frequently
B,In their lives have ever had a pep smear
B,Fifty four point four percent and of this about never mind oh dear I've to lift this thing
B,Uh see how many have had it
B,Eighty-one point five percent had it within the last three years
B,Eight one point five percent of the fifty four
A,Of the fifty four
A,That's not very good uh
B,Ya it's not great
B,But you see the the point I am going to make in this dissertation is it doesn't the utilization rate is not the main thing you see
B,It's catching the high risk groups and screening them
B,And the high risk groups are the groups that are not being screened at present
A,Which are
B,Which are the older you know the people
B,Women who are high risk for cervical cancer the older women lower socio-economic status and uh the Indians
A,Okay Pasir Panjang
A,There isn't a a <unclear> word </unclear> women clinic serving now
B,Clementi
B,Pasir Panjang means Clementi Ayer Rajah and Pasir Panjang
A,Uh okay
B,And West Coast
A,Ya
A,Oops
B,Ya
B,Well anyway it was quite interesting but now that I am
B,Oh dear what has happened
B,Now that I am doing the analysis I found there are a lot of flaws
B,Uh oh I've been putting things on it and it's hung
B,Switch it off
A,You got it on back-up uh
B,Uh
A,You got you got it saved right
B,Ya I wasn't end the program ya
A,Uhm
B,Okay let's move on
A,Are you doing anything else apart from that
A,I heard something like what uhm what mac micro
B,Molecular
A,Molecular <unclear> word </unclear>
B,Molecular epidemiology
B,That's right
A,So count how many molecules there are
B,in epidemiology
A,<unclear> word </unclear> present in that area community
A,Are you going
B,Yep that's a fact
A,For the talk later on
B,Uh no I am going tomorrow
A,<unclear> word </unclear> There's something tomorrow is it
B,It's the same per by the same person

B,Mid-June
A,On uhm molecular epidemiology
B,No it's not
B,It's on Cancer Pathology
A,Okay
B,Molecular epidemiology is a long-term kind of plan
B,If I still have to get the basics sorted out
A,Oh so you haven't started on it
B,I haven't got any like any project you know
B,Uh uh I could have epidemiology but I am trying to get a feel of lab work you know
A,You've to do lab work
A,Kill mice and that sort of thing
B,Well it's up to me I supposed whether ultimately I <unclear> word </unclear> want to do the killing and the <unclear> word </unclear> and all that kind of thing you see
A,What sort of work is it
B,It's well it's molecular epidemiology is using bio marker biological markers in epidemiology you see
A,Okay
B,You know applying epidemiology
A,Sounds like a lot of lab work
B,Ya
B,Blood tissue and things like that
B,But you have a choice you see
B,You can either be an epidemiologist who collaborates with lab people to help them in projects
B,So you do collaborative work or you can actually go into lab work and do things like what Choon Hang and Chen Yang and all that are doing
B,But we have an epidemiology background
B,So you do molecular epidemiology
A,I thought Chen Yang is here to do computer stuff
B,No he's not
B,He's doing uh work on liver
A,Oh is that right
B,<unclear> word </unclear> ya <unclear> word </unclear> toxins
A,But he's in the WHO Computer Collaborating Centre thing
B,That's not Chen Yang
B,That's the other guy there
B,Uh the chap who lives who doesn't works in the computer lab
B,He look a bit like Chen Yang uh
A,That's not Chen Yang
B,Chen Yang is the one who works in that lab
A,Chen Yang is the <unclear> word </unclear>

B,He's a Research Scientist
B,He's got PhD and everything
A,Whoa oh
B,He has right
B,He's Doctor right
