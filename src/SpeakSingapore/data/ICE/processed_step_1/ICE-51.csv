B,So
B,No because okay for the BCD's part lah okay they will say you have to get clearance from all this departments before you submit your plans
A,Ya
B,By this by a specified date you see
B,So if it you know once the due date is near you have to ask for extension right
B,So they still can't get clearance from FSB because all the because already submit to BCD
B,You have to get clearance from all the other departments
B,But this BC this FSB still didn't give clearance you see
A,Ya
B,So they have ask for extension five times already
B,So eventually this BC they say cannot so long already must disapprove
B,No more extension
A,Then how now re-draw everything from scratch
B,Can submit old plans lah but it is like submitting the old drawings same old thing
B,Just that you know I mean except for this er FSB new require I mean FSB requirement lah
