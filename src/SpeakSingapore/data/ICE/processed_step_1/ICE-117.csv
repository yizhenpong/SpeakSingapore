1,<unclear> word </unclear> introduce you to uh Mrs Lee
1,She's a friend of mine from NUS okay and she's going to record this lesson
1,Don't worry
1,It's my <unclear> word </unclear> it's my uhm voice that she wants not so much for <unclear> word </unclear>
1,You after that terrible piece of work you have dare say anything else
1,Uhm right have you all got your papers back
1,Uhm sit down quick
1,Yes
1,Okay can I get the lesson going
1,Danny alright
1,Okay now uhm as you can see from your grades it was not very good
1,I don't know why
1,No it's upon fifteen
1,Dream on
1,Okay now have you got your passage with you
1,Right I think one thing which you all forgot to do was to read the question carefully
1,Okay read question <unclear> word </unclear>
1,The Indians said the fish danced on the beaches at full moon
1,Explain clearly by using your own words what was actually happening and why it only happened when the moon was full
1,Were the fish dancing
1,Did they go one two three one two three
1,No then why didn't you say so
1,Is it
1,Is it understood
1,No it's not that's why they asked you the question in the first place
1,So one of the basic things when you have to state okay
1,Sorry this OHP is not very clear
1,Uhm the first thing you should point out is that it's not true that the fish were actually dancing on the beach
1,You don't state that you have not answered the question at all and that is why most of you ended up with out of four marks I gave you one and a half because you didn't answer the question alright
1,But you have to tell them I mean they are assuming that I mean the Indians say it's one thing right but you know it's not
1,So logically you have to say it's not what the Indians thought it was
1,Then after that you <unclear> word </unclear>
1,It's four marks
1,You have to earn those four marks they're not going to give it to you okay
1,Now carry on with it okay
1,It tells a story the female <unclear> word </unclear> came up onto the beach and uhm lay the eggs in the sand okay
1,But what is important is that she laid them beyond the point where the tide reaches
1,Why
1,The second half of the question asked you right
1,What is the connection with the moon
1,That's why you got to state this point here okay
1,This point
1,It's the circular twisting motion of the fertilizing males that looks like a dance
1,Here you have explained what actually is happening
1,Why is it that the Indians thought the fish were dancing
1,Because the male fish are moving around the female fish
1,Now if this is not there out of four marks I can't even give you two okay
1,The second half of the question
1,What is the connection with the moon
1,The full moon is important because it indicates the high tides when the eggs are laid
1,There are two reasons for this
1,The high tide will bring the female fish up onto the beach because she lays her eggs onto the beach right
1,Then after that what happens
1,After she's laid the eggs she leaves them right
1,She doesn't uhm she doesn't sit on the eggs like say the chicken would to incubate the eggs
1,The eggs are left in the sand unattended to so logically no one else no other fish will come up onto the beach because once the high tide point has been reached subsequent tides will be lower they will be further back
1,It won't come up as high
1,The period of lower tides that follows the eggs will not be affected by the incoming water and can mature undisturbed
1,It will be untouched
1,It takes what nine ten days Then after that the next high tide comes
1,By that time the wa when the water reaches the high tide water mark the fish will be the new fish the newly hatched fish will be ready to go to the sea
1,The water will bring them back
1,That's why there is a connection with the full moon
1,They need the pull the tides gravitational pull okay
1,Now you should be rephrasing your own words you should not have copied gyrate incubate uh undisturbed if possible uhm rephrase it by saying not affected alright
1,The other thing that I think can you please write down somewhere on your answer script or on your passage the tense in which you should be answering your questions in
1,I did not correct every uhm error made in tense because otherwise your whole answer script will be nothing but underlining of grammatical errors
1,What tense should be used when you're answering this type of question
1,Leonard
1,Why past
1,When do you use the present tense the simple present tense
1,When do you use the present tense
1,When do you use present tense
1,Obviously when the question is given in the present tense
1,You use present tense is for when something is happening now right
1,But what about facts and habitual actions
1,They are on-going happening all the time therefore present tense should be used because this is something that happens in nature right
1,And it will happen today it'll happen tomorrow it happened last year it will happen it will continue on for the next twenty years
1,Therefore when you're answering a question like this it should be in the simple present tense
1,When you're asked to describe something that is happening in your text tense should be simple present
1,You're not to use the past tense okay
1,Alright let's move on to the second question
1,Uhm All creatures except man are locked into the environment
1,Explain what this phrase tells you about creatures other than man
1,Illustrate its meaning from what the passage has to say about the hummingbird and the butterfly using your own words as far as possible
1,Alright now this phrase comes from line twenty three right
1,Locked in its environment
1,But the reference to the butterflies and hummingbirds comes in line sixteen seventeen
1,If you are locked somewhere what's the idea there
1,Uhm
1,You're confined you're chained you can't move
1,So the main idea which has to be brought up is that there is a dependency on the environment to survive
1,He is chained to the environment
1,Now how are you going to use the butterflies and the hummingbirds to support your illustration
1,The butterflies they have the ability to camouflage themselves as leaves or poisonous insects okay
1,The hummingbird has the ability to hover and its long-probing beak allows it to suck nectar from the flowers
1,That helps them survive in the environment
1,But what happens if the butterfly doesn't have the flowers any more to feed on
1,It's got a long sharp beak
1,Is it going to be any good for picking up worms or whatever
1,Assuming that it can consume worms
1,No right
1,It's only good for sucking up nectar therefore that implies it's only got one source of food same thing with the uhm sorry what am I talking about
1,It's the hummingbird not the butterfly okay
1,The hummingbird has only got one source of food
1,Now the butterfly brightly-coloured wings
1,What does that allow
1,Protection right
1,In the environment because it's camouflaged
1,But if taken out of that particular environment it's brightly coloured
1,It could be brightly coloured as if it's a flower or it could be very dully coloured so that it becomes inconspicuous
1,But if you put it in another environment will it be very noticeable in this classroom
1,Yes right
1,Therefore the environment provides it with its protection
1,But there is only one form of protection it doesn't have any other means of defence
1,So these adaptations limit the creatures to a specific environment
1,The birds have only source of food the butterflies have no other means of protection and that is why they are locked into that one environment
1,If there're no flowers no nectar the hummingbird hasn't got any other means of food okay
1,Now there's one more thing which I noticed in all your scripts about at least half of your scripts
1,No chalk here
1,Alright now listen to this sentence
1,The butterfly is a creature uhm which has many enemies
1,Their enemies are and then I give you a list
1,What's wrong with sentence The butterfly is a creature with many enemies
1,Their enemies are what's wrong with it
1,Uhm
1,Well doesn't matter
1,There's nothing wrong with that creature
1,It's a grammatical error between the two sentences
1,The first sentence was a butterfly right
1,Then after that I continue it with their
1,Now if you look at your sentences a lot of you make that mistake
1,You started writing off the first half of the sentence with in the singular protect themselves
1,It should be protect himself
1,Do you see that mistake
1,Okay
1,Look for consistency in your answers
1,Okay uhm
1,Ya next one invent
1,He had to invent a pebble and a a flint
1,It could be said that invent is used incorrectly here
1,Why
1,Go back to the passage and reread it right
1,Whenever something is given in text go back and read exactly where it comes from because often the line immediately before that or after it will give you an idea or a clue as to what the question is asking of you okay
1,Okay so line about forty eight before that man is a puny slow awkward unarmed animal
1,He had to invent a pebble a flint a knife a spear
1,Essential these scientific inventions essential to his survival
1,What kind of ideas being brought up here
1,He's unarmed
1,If he's unarmed what does that mean
1,He is
1,Defenceless okay
1,Therefore why does he find these inventions essential
1,They're going to be used as protection weapons okay
1,You've got a knife and you've got a spear
1,Now a very primitive spear
1,How did the caveman prehistoric man make the spear
1,He used a stone right
1,He sharpened the edge and then he attached it onto a stick perhaps and that's it
1,That's a spear
1,So that's where your connection of a pebble a flint a knife and a spear > ICE-SIN:S1B-017#> That's why you've got these two simple things followed on with two inventions You see it's a bit odd right
1,Now you can invent a spear but you cannot invent a pebble
1,So you've got to bring out that idea but the first thing that you forgot is that invent you have to give the meaning behind it otherwise you can't explain why it's incorrectly used
1,State that
1,To invent is to produce or create something that did not exist previously or was not in existence
1,And then you go on and elaborate
1,Peb pebbles already exist uhm nature-endowed
1,God-given whatever
1,So these two together will give you one mark
1,Most of you gave me only this which will give you only half a mark alright
1,Now Part b uh I think most of you went wrong here
1,What does the author mean by this statement
1,Goes back to what I discussed with you earlier
1,With reference to invent and what he was trying to invent okay
1,The author means to discover or invent a use for the pebble
1,You use it transform it into a weapon because man is weak
1,He doesn't have uhm he's not he doesn't have any body adaptations which offer a form of protection to him
1,He doesn't have sharp claws
1,Alright he doesn't have sharp teeth okay
1,Alright now I also return you your uhm exercise which you did for me explaining metaphors
1,Some of you in that exercise you followed the correct structure just as then whatever it is so
1,Right remember that structure which I ask you to pay attention to
1,Now what you've got are three metaphoric phrases which you've been asked to explain <X>
1,Even if you don't like following the structure 'just as' and 'so' you should have remembered that you are supposed to explain the literal meaning of metaphor first and then relate it back into the context First one would be 'an animal fits into its environment just uhm like one cogwheel into another' What you've got to explain is the concept of a cogwheel Right What is it You think of a cogwheel you think of gears you think of wheels with With what What's so special about gears They've got two wheels right If I've got two wheels and I put them together is that a gear Why Mhm The edges they are grooved serated right They've got teeth on them so that when you put the two together they interlock and the turning of one wheel will turn the other wheel It's this kind of principle What's going on What's the problem I want to finish this first then I want to use the OHP Is that a problem Okay explain to me the concept of a cogwheel Explain to me Explain to me what I've just explained Pay attention next time uh okay Right the idea of teeth on a wheel okay One fitting into another interlocking So it's this idea of once you've explained that here right it's this idea of the smooth inevitable interlocking of creature and environment How the animal is able to adapt itself to suit its surroundings perfectly You explain this one first right a cogwheel wheel with teeth on it uhm the idea of gear one wheel turning another it's it's connected they fit perfectly and then you go on and explain how it is in use in the passage So this will be one mark and this one will be one mark </X> </I>
