A,Good evening
A,The People's Action Party led by Mr Goh Chok Tong who assumed premiership just ten years ago was returned to power when nominations closed at twelve thirty p.m. today
A,It's the ninth successive victory for the PAP in the general election
A,Our special report tonight give detail gives details of the walkovers and fights in the constituencies the major statements of party leaders at their press conferences and finally an analysis of the issues by three political commentators
A,No one could have expected the general election so soon in fact the opposition calls it the snappiest of snap election but Mr Goh says he wants an endorsement now for his style of government and his program
A,He says he is the issue and the ground is sweet
A,Well who will be contesting who has already won what's the score like at the end of Nomination Day
B,The PAP has a lot to cheer about its Mr Goh Chok Tong's first general election as Prime Minister and he says this is <unclear> word </unclear> number of candidates since 1980
B,By the time the nominations closed at noon today the PAP has fielded eighty-one candidates and the opposition parties thirty-eight
B,Seven independents will also be vying for a seat in the new parliament making a total of one hundred and twenty-six this election
B,Of the five opposition parties in the red this year the Singapore Democratic Party has nine candidates the Workers' Party thirteen the National Solidarity Party eight the Singapore Malay National Organisation or PKMS four and the Singapore Justice Party four
B,The total number of opposition candidates this election is forty-five down from seventy-five in 1988 and fifty-one in 1984
B,This turn of events has given the PAP a large number of walkovers forty-one
B,In terms of wards ten out of the fifteen GRCs and one out of the twenty-one single seats have been captured by the ruling party even before the hustling have begun
B,In other words almost fifty percent of the registered voters do not have to go to the polls
B,As pre-nomination speculation had predicted the opposition parties have avoided putting up a strong challenge in the GRCs
B,With the new requirement for four candidates in each GRC one of whom must be a member of a minority group it looks like the opposition has decided they'll have better chances in the single member wards instead
B,Twelve ministers were returned unopposed they include Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew
B,For the first time he's running with three other candidates in the expanded Tanjong Pagar GRC
B,Deputy Prime Minister Ong Teng Cheong also had a walkover in Toa Payoh GRC
C,We're disappointed I'm sure all our supporters here are disappointed we're all ready for a fight for a contest
A,Yes Ang Mo Kio GRC has now gone to the People's Action Party and the hundreds of supporters here are just screaming over with excitement
A,BG Lee who picked up one of the highest votes in the last election is positively elated
A,I'm going to try to break through the crowd to get a response from him
D,I'm in a midst of uh disappointment
D,We have hope for contest but election is not over and we're fighting all of the seats
B,The PAP supporters have been going absolutely wild for the past few minutes the reason the newly formed Kampong Glam GRC has gone uncontested
B,I ask the Minister for Defence Dr Yeo Ning Hong if he was relieved he didn't have to go up against any opposition this time
E,But a little disappointed the uh supporters are all geared up to uh uh fight a good fight ah there won't be any contest
E,The four constituencies which make up Kampong Glam has uh in 1988 uh given us better than average uh votes so we are in a sense disappointed that uh we will not be able to uh pull in the extra votes
B,Another Minister with a walk-over was Environment Minister Dr Ahmad Mattar who's now returned to Brickworks GRC
F,Well I think we feel happy but at the same time we well especially our our activists feel a little bit disappointed in the sense that uh they were all prepared for a contest
B,The only single-member ward with a walk-over was Kreta Ayer the seat for Finance Minister Dr Richard Hu
B,Among the new MPs the walk-overs were Kenneth Chen where in 1988 lost to SDP Chiam See Tong in Potong Pasir
B,Having captured more than half the eighty-one parliamentary seats the PAP still faces a fight in the remaining forty seats five GRCs and twenty single-member wards
B,Five ministers will be facing opposition challenges Professor Jayakumar Lee Yock Suan Mah Bow Tan Seet Ai Mei and the Prime MInister himself
A,Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong arrived at eleven thirty cheered on heartily by his supporters from Marine Parade GRC
A,Expectations that the opposition would contest Marine Parade GRC have been fulfilled
A,Candidates for the Singapore Justice Party filed in quietly at eleven forty a.m. <unclear> word </unclear> supporters dominate outside in the car-park cheering and waving banners and there don't seem to be any supporters for the opposition
G,Well there certainly an air of excitement here where a keenly contested fight for Bedok GRC is expected once again
G,The PAP is being led by a strong team by Professor Jayakumar Dr Arthur Beng Mr Abdullah Tarmugi and Mr Tan Soo Khoon who has been moved over from Brickworks for the last from the last fifteen years but the opposition is undeterred by this
G,They have once again decide to fight against the PAP however with an entire new team can they do better this time
H,I agree that PAP has put up a very strong team here and I'm not afraid of that and I'm looking forward to the good fight
I,I've just uh seen the names of the candidates uh I don't see that any of them has been active in Bedok or has done anything for the residents in Bedok
I,Uh we are looking forward to a fight and we are confident that with our team of four my colleagues Arthur Beng uh Tan Soo Khoon and uh Dullah Tarmugi we will be able to put up a good fight and get the support from the voters
B,Among the MPs who will be facing contest in their wards are Dr Tan Cheng Bock in Ayer Rajah who's challenged by Mohamed Aziz Bin Ibrahim from PKMS
B,In Bukit Batok Dr Ong Chit Chung will face Kuan Yew Keng from the SDP
B,One closely watched constituency will be Tanglin which for the first time since 1963 will be contested
B,PAP's Liew Sim Pao will face Jimmy Tan of the SDP and M G Guru an independent
J,Well I'm excited about it and I think my voters are equally excited because on my walkabouts many of them expressed to me the uh their wish to cast their vote
J,They've not excise their right for a long time and I am glad that this opportunity has risen for them to cast their vote and I hope they will support the PAP government
K,One of the most keenly contested areas is expected to be Potong Pasir where SDP leader Mr Chiam See Tong has been MP since 1984
K,The mood here is electric SDP's supporters are here and so are the PAP who are out in full force to support new candidate Mr Andy Gan
K,But the question is will Mr Gan be able to reclaim Potong Pasir for the PAP
L,Chances are good even though Mr Chiam has been working there for a long time because uh all PAP candidates stand a good chance and furthermore I've worked in the constituency for eight years also and uh people know me and I think they will give me their support
M,These two who have probably got great positions uh for them in the government have been moved away from Potong Pasir and now they are putting a a candidate which they have not announced in uh to have any positions so you can decide for yourself what what do you think is my competitor
B,This year the opposition is scaling back the size of its challenge to the PAP
B,Part of the reason is that one party the SDP has decided to use the strategy of treating this year's polls as a by-election
B,They're hoping that by fielding fewer candidates the PAP would be able to form the government on Nomination Day
B,This will make it easier for the opposition to win more seats on August the thirty-first
B,However BG Yeo has this to say
N,I don't quite understand the by-election strategy you know I think they are making a virtue of necessity because they have great difficulty getting candidates
N,I mean to have good candidates you must have people who feel that there are strong rallying causes which make it worth their while to jump into the fray
N,They've not been able to get very many good people so they decided to concentrate their effort and therefore to say that it's a by-election strategy in other words it is making a virtue out of necessity
B,This year there seems to be a greater measure of co-operation among the opposition parties
B,Their strategy is to pool their candidates together to form GRC teams strong enough to challenge the PAP
B,In Eunos GRC the PAP faces an opposition team which includes the former member of the SDP Mr Mohamed Jufrie Mahmood
B,He joins NPMP Lee Chiew Choh Wee Han KIm and Maurice Yeo from Workers' Party
B,It is at this constituency where the PAP won its closest fight in 1988
B,This time round they're again fielding Senior Minister of State for Education Dr Tay Eng Soon and he's also joined by his colleagues Sidek Saniff and Chew Heng Cheng and Charles Chong
O,One must not be too too self-confident in this matter you know uh I think we still have to work hard to win the elections but uh we've been uh talking to various groups of people and uh trying to see whether there are any major issues that and unhappiness they have uh
O,So far they have brought out very few
P,What do you think of chance your chances of becoming a full MP this time around
Q,Well we've always been optimistic
P,What makes you think that this strategy of moving into Workers' Party will work I mean uh instead
R,Well I cannot tell you for sure that it'll work but I think it gives us the best chance and I being in touch and having close close rapport with the leadership of the SDP and the WP I think I should be able to bring these two parties together
B,The opposition has concentrated its efforts on the single-member wards for example <unclear> word </unclear> of the Jurong Junior College Nomination centre are being contested
S,These PAP supporters have come out in full force to cheer their side on and it's this kind of support that the PAP will have to count on <unclear> word </unclear>
S,For the second time running SDP Chairman Mr Ling How Doong will be up against Dr Seet Ai Mee
S,Dr Seet won by a narrow margin in the 1988 election
T,When I met Mr Ling in 1988 I was not completely not known to Singapore and uh very and had very little exposure even in the consitu the new constituency of Bukit Gombak
T,In the last three years I have worked hard to be a good MP to my residents and have tried to develop facilities which the residents needed and have gained great rapport with them so it is uh it will still be a hard fight uh but it will be a test of the residents' appreciation uh and whether and that their support for me to carry on the kind of work I've done with them in the last three years
U,I expect those who supported me at the last general election in 1988 would support me this time round and then I would expect those who supported Dr Seet they would turn round and support me because of all those very harsh policies of the government <X>
