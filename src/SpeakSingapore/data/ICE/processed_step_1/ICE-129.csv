A,Okay I think with that we can come to our studio guest Suresh
A,I know you're raring to tell us your point of view as well
A,Okay as a person who came up with the uh kiasu comic uh books and the kiasu character what is your reaction to the calls so far
B,Well first of all there were a couple of us that got together to do the book and I must say that uhm a comic book a kiasu comic book is not a promotion of kiasuism
B,On the contrary it is suppose to make Singaporeans more aware of the kiasu behaviours and that was what sort of uh inspired us to do the book in the first place
B,We're in the humour business and we tend to look on the lighter side of things
B,It is fine to say have a anti-kiasu campaign and we would probably support it but being people in the humour business we do it you know by looking at the funny side of it
A,Okay Agnes is there a down side to this funny side
C,Well if they were to look at it the same way as Suresh and his co-writer which look at it is uhm looking at humour and that we should learn to laugh at ourselves I think there's nothing wrong with it
C,However you find that uh depending on the maturity of the readers then young children may think that well if that's the way of life in Singapore and if it is being uh publicised so why not and on the other hand of course with this uhm capitalisation by commercial firms of using Mr Kiasu to promote their goods I think it can sort <unclear> word </unclear> in a way be blown out of uh view you see
A,But I mean wouldn't wouldn't you say that the use of humour to convey messages even that uhm that are negative in this way that to discourage people from from emulating those that those personality traits it's always been done and I presume you are you are following that tradition
B,Yes I think uh people are bombarded with all kinds of messages especially in Singapore campaign after campaign telling them what they should do and what they shouldn't do
B,Sometimes it would be effective to use humour because a person gets entertained and in the process perhaps some of the messages get through
B,But if you were to tell him that he shouldn't do this and that he gets turned off and we think that we're probably uh more effective in getting the anti-kiasu message across than promoting kiasuism
A,Agnes would you say that that is uhm is there a cautionary note to that
A,I'm sure you wouldn't disagree with that by saying how <unclear> word </unclear> we wouldn't
C,Well no I wouldn't
C,Well as I said before you see you are trying to tell them not to be kiasu but you have no control over how they view it
C,Will they be taking it as a lesson yes it's something we shouldn't do or it's something that well it's something that we should emulate so
B,I think we should uh sorry I think we should give credit to young people even children uh sometimes we tend to think that they get easily influenced by comics
B,We all grow up by watching Popeye the sailor and we haven't become started speaking like Popeye
A,Okay okay thank you thank you very much I think with that we've come to the end of this part of the discussion and it's clear that kiasu promotions are meant to allow us to laugh at ourselves at least that's the intention and yes I think we we we need to do more of that but the problem is are we celebrating a behaviour that's not that funny that selfish inconsiderate behaviour
A,Well I know you're raring to tell us some of your own personal encounters okay the number to call is six nine one one three double zero that's six nine one one three zero zero
A,Just keep dialing that number we want to hear your experiences with the kiasus after this break(Phone-in interviews)
A,Okay I think with that we will come to our studio guests again
A,The the importance of drawing a distinction between qualities that are obviously bad okay like what we talked about so far and the good qualities like being diligent being hardworking being cautious
A,Do you think this is important to make a distinction between the two
C,Oh yes as a matter of fact I think that uhm when we first coin the word being kiasu is always very negative in terms of being greedy a selfish grabby so but when we try to link up that with competitiveness in terms of being prepared and being diligent I don't think it should be uhm come under the same term as being kiasu
C,Instead as a matter of fact it's a good strategy in terms of being prepared for any kind of challenges and that comes under the same strategies as shun zi ping fa
C,So I think we have to be very distinctive about what we called the kiasuism and what is being called being prepared in terms of some kind of working strategies
A,Would would you say that uh some Singaporeans are using this as a crutch as it were for lack of better way of putting it for their own inadequacies but blaming other people who are hardworking by calling them kiasu
C,Oh yes I would think so because as a matter of fact you find that the people have been using the word kiasu so loosely I would say that we have to think very carefully as what is their definition of kiasu because I think that there could be ten different definitions for kiasu according to what the person wants
A,Yah talking about definitions Suresh did you take into account this this this point when you came up with the books
B,Our understanding of kiasu is someone who wants to win at all cost
B,A person who works hard I'll give you an example perhaps the Olympic games Carl Lewis and Ben Johnson Karl Lewis wants to win
B,Perhaps he trains twelve hours a day Ben Johnson also wants to win but he uses an unfair method uses drugs
B,That is a kiasu you know a person who wants to win at all cost even unfair so if people can understand that difference I think a lot of these fears are quite unfounded
A,But do you feel that that difference comes through clearly without being ambiguous in your books
B,In our books
A,Uhm
B,Uh we make a special effort to show whenever Mr Kiasu does something uh bad he pays for it
B,You see there's a situation where he tries to beat someone to it to to grab a taxi at the end of which he goes onto a lane gets run over by a taxi
B,That's the kind of situations that we put into the book so you know
A,Last comment from Agnes a cautionary note very quickly
C,Yes oh uh here I think that uh what Suresh is doing is is something very positive but I have one word to add and in the sense that uh being kiasu children will learn not just from just the comics alone but from the behaviour of adults
C,That's what I'm very much afraid of because if adults felt that it's it's quite a a fair game to be kiasu the young children because not all of them will read the comics but they will observe the important adults around them and that's my greatest fear
A,Words of wisdom really
A,Thank you very much
A,Thank you Suresh thank you Agnes
C,Thank you
A,Well with that comment we can quite comfortably wrap up this discussion I think
A,Thank you panelists for joining me in the studio
A,Well what can I say
A,Looks like we are living in quite a miserable country plagued by selfish inconsiderate kiasus
A,Hey but is that really true
A,Is kiasuism so rampant a trade that it is the hallmark of the Singaporean as suggested by some of us
A,Yes we are kiasu and we should do something about it but are not being a little too hard on ourselves sometimes
A,Why do we have to swing between we are number one breast beating uh to we are kiasu brow beating
A,Come on let's give ourselves more credit
A,We do have our redeeming qualities and we're not really that different from the people in other countries
A,Let's not be so kiasu
A,Thank you for calling in and remember if it concerns you it concerns us
A,This has been Talking Point </I>
D,Alright Doctor Chua you've just heard uhm from a few calls
D,Do you think that that's a fair assessment that you know we stereotype people
E,Well uhm I'm glad most of the callers justify that there is a mi <unclear> word </unclear> a small majority of pe <unclear> word </unclear> employers who are uh abusing their maids
E,But uhm employers most employers are not stereotype neither are maids
E,Uh there are good maids there are bad maids so we shall concentrate on the bad maids
E,Uhm to stereotype I don't think it's a good uh point for a discussion because sometimes we have to recognise that maids if they are pushed to the wall they have no other way but to uh react the way they do
D,Doctor Chung do you agree with uhm Doctor Chua's assessment
F,Yes to an extent I feel that the whole issue of uh employer maid relationship is actually quite complex because the <unclear> word </unclear> the relationship between the employer and employee is actually quite different from that of any other work situation
F,When you hire a maid you're actually employing her to undertake house work and child care for example
F,These are actually very broad terms which can cover a wide multitude of tasks for example and therefore <unclear> word </unclear> it is difficult to draw parameters as to what exactly constitute the task that should be done
F,So because of this there could be difficulties uh by interpreting what should be the parameters for her job
F,I think additional another point to be made also is that in reference to a call that was made earlier on about how when you pay two fifty then you expect to get that much service out of her
F,It it has got to be realised is and and this is a point that has been made by Doctor Nirmala PuruShotam who is research on the subject
F,Now actually what is happening when you employ your maid is that you actually moving from house work that was done for free by the woman of the house that is the wife and the mother to now uhm work that you have to pay for
F,In other words you're actually paying two hundred and fifty dollars and and more because if if you take in consideration board and lodgings where previously it was serviced without a fee
D,Doctor Chua do you think why do you think that kind of mentality arises I mean as a psychologist
E,About uh employers abusing their maids
D,No about the fact that because we pay a certain amount of money we expect this kind of uhm service
E,That uhm there is a possibility uh possible uh explanation what we re generally referred to as transference uh theory whereby most employers they're working in a working environment as an employees
E,Employers who are generally bad to them generally they like to take this uh phenomena back home and transfer it to the employees which is their maid
E,Uh but uh we have to recognise that employers work in a different environment maids work in another environment
E,The maids are most subservient to them rather than employee uhm employers themselves who are employees in the work place so it's usually a transference phenomena here <X>
