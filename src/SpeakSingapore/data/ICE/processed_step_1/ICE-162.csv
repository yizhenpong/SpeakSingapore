A,Mister Yeoh can you tell the Court the nature of your work experience
B,I've been managing director of this company Technikem laboratories Services for fourteen years
B,And we have been handling a lot of analyses a lot of laboratory investigations and testings since incorporation in nineteen seventy seven
A,Do you actually perform the laboratory tests
B,Yes
B,I have a group of lab staff but for this particular instance I was the one that I handled the whole thing
A,Now tell us how much experience do you have in analysing paints and thinners
B,We don't analyse very many samples in paint but thinners yes as a solvent
B,We do quite a number of analyses on thinners
A,Is this the first occasion that you have been asked to analyse a paint
B,No
B,We did paint analysis before but not in this manner
B,Not in this manner
A,But you have not analysed paints on many occasions is that correct
B,Yes it's not that many occasions
A,Now you have said that you have not been asked to analyse a paint in this manner
A,I believe you are referring to the manner in A B forty four
B,I mean in this investigative manner
B,I was referring to this to carry out tests spray and this and that
B,This is not
B,We always analyse as a product
A,So who suggested this method of testing for you
B,It's between the discussion of myself and Mister Lee
B,Do you know whether Mister Lee is a chemistry expert
A,No I don't know
B,Now why then being a professional chemist uh did you have to discuss the test method with Mister Lee
A,Of course
A,Mister Lee is my principal in this instance
A,I have to discuss with him about the manner or what which I mean it's a mutual it is a
A,He's my principal so I have to discuss with him
A,I just can't take a sample and do it myself in my own way without his approval because he's paying the bill
A,Now did Mister Lee ask you
A,What did Mister Lee tell you the objective of the test in A B forty four
B,Which one
B,You mean for these two reports
A,Yes we'll start with forty four first
B,Thirty four not thirty three
A,Forty four first
B,Forty four is the later one
A,Never mind
B,Okay
B,Yes I knew the background of the problem that he said
B,The paint applied on the acrylic board then to get cobwebs and peel off and so on
B,I knew the background of the you know
B,The reason for doing the investigation
A,Could you tell us in full your understanding of the background to this problem
A,Tell us in detail
B,As far as I understand from Mister Lee
B,That he showed me a sign of the Shell's logo
B,And that there was paint that already painted on the surface shows signs of cracks
B,And I think one or two and I think one or two position had peeled off
A,Now therefore can you tell us what is the objective of your report in A B forty four
B,As what I mentioned earlier it's to simulate the way that they applied the paint on the material
B,And see whether you have uh the same effect as what they have observed earlier
A,In other words the objective of your test was to recreate the same result
A,Is that correct
B,I don't say same result but just as an experiment to see whether to simulate the actual way of application
B,And see whether we see what type of result to get that's all
A,But your ultimate objective was to see whether the paint would crack
B,Yes
A,Now was it your objective in this test in A B forty four to find out the cause of cracking
B,No
A,In other words you would not be able to say anything about the cause of the cracks is that
B,Not in this particular report not the cause of the cracks
B,But it's an observation that's all
A,I refer you now to this A B forty four the details of it
A,Alright at introduction line three you said by applying various Kansai coloured paints diluted with plat top thinner
A,What coloured paints were these
B,All sorts of colours
B,White yellow red black
A,Four colours five colours
B,Well one two three four
A,And you diluted these paints only with plat top number eleven
B,I didn't dilute
B,It was if you read the report
B,It was diluted by the well by the workers when I was there
B,That is stated in my report
A,Where does it say
B,It said diluted with plat top thinners on clean acrylic boards with the help of Mister Lee Ah Yong of Comsign and his technicians
A,In other words these paints samples were diluted
B,In front of me during my presence
A,By Comsign officers
B,Yes
A,In your presence
B,Yes
A,Now Mister Yeoh are you able to comment whether the dilution by these officers of Comsign is a proper one
B,Proper in what sense
A,Suitable for application
B,Well I put it again in my application
B,The paint on the third paragraph the paint was then diluted with a thinner to a certain degree which by the opinion of Mister Lee was suitable for spraying
A,In other words Mister Yeoh on the question of dilution you left it to the opinion of Mister Lee
B,Yes
A,As to what was suitable
B,Uhm I think can I make a comment on that
A,Yes sure
B,Because I think they because they are using a sprayer so they are the one who knows best how dilute or how viscous the paint should be for their own sprayer
A,Yes but Mister Yeoh would you not agree that if a paint is excessively or under diluted it would have unsatisfactory effects on the outcome of the paint work
B,Can you just repeat it please
A,If someone were to over dilute the paint would that not affect the result
B,Well I think if a paint is over diluted you will find that it would not be able to stick on as good as what it
B,There is a certain percentage that you have to mix and you can't be too dilute because it would not stay
A,It would crack
B,I don't know whether it will crack or or
A,It will peel off
B,Probably even when it dry off
B,Probably everything will be gone because if it's too dilute
B,That means you
B,I'm not too sure how I can put it to you but in my opinion is you have to have a certain degree of mixing before you can make the paint stays
A,Okay Mister Yeoh in other words there is a correct proportion of dilution of paints
B,Yes
A,And if you were to over dilute the result would be unsatisfactory
B,Well it will be generally unsatisfactory
A,And yet Mister Yeoh in this test on the question of the suitable dilution of paints you left it to Mister Lee or his workers
B,Yes I mean the reason I explained earlier that they supposed to know best that what is the concentration required for their sprayer
B,Because if you have too concentrated you may find problem to spray out
B,If too dilute also you will be you know flying all over the place
B,So I presume that they have been doing this job for years
B,They should know what is the best
B,That's why I put in in their opinion you know
A,I asks you again Mister Yeoh do you agree that if you were to over dilute or under dilute a paint plastic paint it may cause cracking of the paint cracking or peeling
B,I would not comment on that no
B,But I would imagine that in fact in the first place if you
A,No sorry sorry you are not able to comment or you will not comment on that
B,I would not be able to comment
A,But you agree that there is a suitable range of dilution
B,Yes
B,May I add
A,Yes
B,In my opinion the paint that appears here the painted surface in my opinion is reasonable in the sense that it's not a diluted over diluted type of paint that is to stick on this <X>
B,Chief Justice: Can you repeat that please </X>
B,No in my opinion this particular for this particular sample these two samples
B,I think it has been properly applied with suitable amount of paint there is not the over diluted paint
B,That's what you like to put it to me just now
B,Because we can see the paint it is not a thin paint
B,It is not a thin paint work
A,I'll come back to that later Mister Yeoh when you say you conduct a test under experimental conditions
A,Should not you or your laboratory staff be conducting every aspect of the test
B,No it's not necessary This is not the first instance that we carry out investigation in this manner
B,It is not necessary that we have to do from A to Z
B,In fact we leave it to whoever who knows best to do it but of course to our own satisfaction
A,Next paragraph
A,The acrylic boards used were fresh from stock
A,What do you mean by that
B,Yes because it was taken out from a wrapping
B,In my opinion it is fresh
A,Now what size and shape is this
B,This is a for this particular one all this are original shape
A,Now did you examine the boards with the cracked paint
B,Which board which board you're talking about
B,You're talking about this sample or you're talking
A,No the boards that were painted by the Plaintiffs
B,You mean the signboard you're talking about
A,Yes
B,Yes I saw the signboard myself
A,Did you examine them
B,Yes
A,Are these the ones with the Shell logo
B,Sorry
A,Are these the ones with the Shell logo
B,Yes with the Shell logo
A,Now are the cracks that appeared in your experiment of the same nature as the ones that were painted by Plaintiffs
B,Similar the cracks look similar
A,Are you satisfied that the cracks in the experiment and on the boards painted by the Plaintiffs were caused by the same cause
B,I have no comment on what
A,You have no comment
B,No I have no comment on that
A,And under Observations second paragraph second line you said it could not be confirmed if the acrylic board had been affected as well as removal of paint by a solvent could tarnish the acrylic surface
B,Yes
A,Can you explain this
B,What really we meant in this report was we saw the cracks
B,Okay this is on a applied surface and this is a unapplied surface and now you read the cracks from this end from the unapplied surface and you can see the cracks you can see the cracks
B,If you like we have to like to show to the Lord <X>
B,Chief Justice: These are the cobweb-like cracks </X>
B,Yes Yes that's how the
B,So by these observations we could not confirm that whether the acrylic surface has whether these cracks only on the paint itself or whether it has eaten into the acrylic surface
B,That is what I mean I could not confirm
A,Witness I next refer you to A B thirty three your other report
A,Now under item H you have stated plastic strips said to be made of acrylic plastic material
A,Why have you qualified the words in that manner
B,Well we did not confirm that whether this is acrylic or not
B,It's said to be because it was given to us and said this is an acrylic board
B,That's why we put down as said to be
A,In other words you cannot confirm that this is an acrylic board
B,Well if we were to ask to confirm we could do another test to confirm whether this is acrylic material or not
B,But at that instance we just because after all the board was given to us say this was the board that's been used for the actual paint work </I>
