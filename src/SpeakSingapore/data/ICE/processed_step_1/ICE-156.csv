A,H J Ministry of Community Development Amendment number one
A,We have twenty five minutes Mr Abdullah Tarmugi
B,Sir I beg to move that the total sum to be allocated for H J of the main estimates be reduced by one hundred dollars
B,Mr Chairman Sir in any country there will be families and individuals whose standard of living fall below others because of their low incomes
B,In Singapore Sir we do not see the crippling poverty that exists in some countries
B,In slums in the streets begging hustling others
B,Ours is more subtle but it nevertheless lurks behind the doors of our rented flats
B,Official estimates put the number of low income families at thirty eight thousand
B,This is defined as those families whose incomes fall below the minimum household expenditure level of about five hundred eleven dollars for the family of four people
B,Some of these families Sir are further disadvantaged by chronic and multiple problems in the family thus putting the children at risk
B,Children Sir are inevitably caught in the poverty of their environments not only economically but also emotionally and socially
B,These families need our help
B,That question is who is to help them
B,My TPC Sir states categorically that we do not subscribe to welfare state model as found in many countries in the west
B,Apart from the government the community and the families themselves will have to work in concert to address the problems of low income families
B,But still we believe that government will have to play a leading role in setting the tone of this tripartite co-operation in setting the rules in providing the basic infrastructure and in creating the atmosphere where the community will be motivated to help the families to be motivated and the families themselves to improve
B,In this context Sir let me touch on the question of subsidies
B,The GPC goes along with the government that mindless injections of subsidies into welfare or those which merely finance consumption should not be encouraged not entertained
B,But Sir subsidies which seek to improve those who receive them into becoming more self-reliant and more independent should not be ruled out altogether
B,Indeed government should not shy at granting subsidies which aim at these objectives
B,They are needed and they are they also serve as an encouragement to others in the community to come forward and help
B,Can the Minister therefore elaborate in this House the government's approach to social welfare and to helping the needy in our midst
B,What kinds of assistance is it prepared to render to those families and how is it encouraging VWOs or Voluntary Welfare Organizations and the community
B,Sir I beg to move
A,Question is that the total sum to be allocated for H J of the main estimates to be reduced by one hundred dollars Mr Das
C,Mr Chairman Sir
C,I've two cuts
C,Can I take them
A,Yes
C,Mr Chairman Sir as for my first cut I will just direct one question to the Minister that is what is the government doing to enhance sports performance in general
C,And in particular with the forthcoming South-east Asian Games to be staged in Singapore nineteen ninety three
C,Are there any special programs to improve our haul of golds during these game
C,Sir I move on to my next cut which is which is recognition for national sportsmen
C,Mr Chairman Sir Singapore has in the fifties and sixties produced world class sportsmen
C,To name a few well like Wong Peng Soon in badminton Ong Poh Lin badminton Ismail Maja badminton Tan Ow Liang weightlifting Neo Choo Kok swimming
C,In the eighties and nineties one world class sportsman which we have produced possibly Mr Ang Peng Siong
C,And uh no other name comes to my mind
C,Why is this so
C,Especially when we have better facilities better and more modern facilities now than in the fifties and sixties
C,The reason I believe may be Sir that sports or talent in sports is not given its due recognition in Singapore
C,Sportsmen give their best part of their career or age say from sixteen or in the case of swimmers even younger go up to sixteen to twenty four
C,and then they fade away with no guarantee of a secure livelihood
C,and there are of course other pressures
C,Other talent be it academic arts I believe has been looked after reasonably well and this is not the case for sports
C,Sir if we want our standard to improve then I believe something should be done
C,Not everything should be done by the government but I believe government can lead the way and this can be strongly followed by the private sector
C,Sir when Ang Peng Siong wins a gold medal it brings joy and pride to all Singaporeans especially when the Majulah Singapura is played
C,When Fandi scores a goal fifty thousand Singaporeans roar in ecstasy
C,For all these what do they get
C,Ang Peng Siong now works in a club and advertises for Fab
C,Sir I think the best of our sportsmen with talent must be nurtured and looked up
C,Something is being done for our footballers right now
C,and I think the FAS should be congratulated
C,and I think more will be done in the near future
C,Sir government particularly the Ministry of Defence together with private sector companies could help to nurture our talent in sports by guaranteed guaranteeing them a certain amount of livelihood
C,and at the same time allowing them to continue to excel in the sports of their choice
C,I hope Sir the Ministry of Community Development and the real Minister for Sports to look into this aspect
C,Thank you
A,Mr Singh
D,Mr Chairman Sir
D,I would like to support everything that Mr Chandra Das has said
D,Sir for some reason we do not do very well in sports when we compete internationally
D,I can understand that for a long time now we have been motivated by a need to succeed economically and that's laudable
D,But we don't really have to compromise on that principle or objective
D,There there is a group of people in Singapore very athletically inclined and who for some reason are not inclined towards studies
D,and then don't make it to the university or other tertiary institutions
D,If we don't give them incentives they're not likely to continue to play the games that they excel in with the result that they don't do well in life either in seeking a job
D,and they don't exploit their sporting talents to the maximum
D,Now then you therefore what you have is this group of people who are who don't do well in life and at the same time Singapore loses out on this pool of talent
D,We've done economically we have concentrated on the arts
D,We have need reaching for other ideals now
D,I would urge the government to pay more attention to sports not only because the SEA Games is around the corner but because sports has a unique way of bringing people together
D,I've said this before
D,We can do so much better in getting Singaporeans to be passionate about our own country than by National Day events or by Orchard Road Swings big parties that we have
D,These events are contrived to get Singaporeans together and to feel something for the country
D,But there is a there is a way we can do this without having to spend millions of dollars
D,And this is by encouraging our best sportsmen
D,Those who are not inclined to pursue a career or to to take their studies further to concentrate their talents where they have them on the field
D,For example football
D,my colleague has said fifty thousand people are cheering
D,No doubt a lot of them have other motivations
D,They've got money on the game perhaps
D,But there is this other group
D,A huge majority who derive including me a tremendous amount of satisfaction and pleasure when we win
D,and when you cheer you're cheering for Singapore and everybody identifies with the country for once
D,There is a lot to be said about government taking the lead in setting aside a few jobs for the athletically inclined so that they can attend to their jobs from nine a.m. to three p.m. and then get out to the fields and concentrate on their sporting talents
D,Build a great team in soccer in any other sport and get out there and compete internationally
D,And if the government takes the lead the private sector will follow
D,If we don't do that we'll never get anywhere in sports
D,Sport is a unifying force we should concentrate on it
D,Thank you Sir
A,Yeo
E,Thank you Mr Speaker
E,Sir first of all I'd like to thank my uh three colleagues who've spoken up on the first cut
E,Sir Mr Tarmugi has asked about what is the government's approach to those in need
E,He has stated very clearly that the GPC does not subscribe to a welfare state
E,That the members do not subscribe to just throwing money at the situation
E,Sir the government's approach to social welfare is the many helping hands approach involving a partnership between government and the various civic community and welfare organizations
E,Sir social welfare issues are difficult issues to deal with in any society
E,Long term vision and perseverance are necessary and it require a painstaking effort
E,And the results only show up many years later
E,Similarly welfare assistance programs which go wrong are very difficult to unravel
E,We've seen many countries in which this has happened
E,They started off with very good intentions but end up only aggravating the problems instead of solving them
E,For example many countries have unemployment benefits
E,Very generous ones to help those who are temporarily unemployed
E,What happened is that all these programs instead ended up encouraging people to stay unemployed
E,In America the welfare programs started off also with very good intentions with very manageable budgets
E,Today social security and welfare is the largest single item in the US federal budget taking up more than one third its budget
E,We therefore are on good grounds in being very careful
E,Sir our focus in our social welfare programs is to help the needy get back on their own two feet
E,Tax payers' money goes only into programs which are designed to motivate and help them to become independent rather than to dampen their drive to be independent
E,Sir our experience shows that giving money for example through our rents and utilities uh scheme alone is not adequate
E,We had let me quote a case
E,We had a case of a thirty eighty thirty eight year old divorced lady with two schooling children who are temporarily on the rents rent and utilities assistance scheme for six months
E,She was first working as a night-shift uh worker because she thought that that way she can help look after her children in the day-time
E,But she was not earning enough money
E,And also because after working late at night she's really too tired in day-time to help to look after the children
E,So she left and got a part-time job as a cleaner
E,It paid even less
E,As a result she was in arrears in her uh PUB bills and in her HDB rental payments
E,So HDB referred her case to the Council of Social Services which administers the RUAS scheme the Rent and Utilities Assistance scheme
E,Vouchers were then given to her to help her tide over pay her financial difficulties
E,But over and above that a social worker from the Asian Women's welfare association helped her to look for another job which paid her more and at the same time helped her to spend more time with her children
E,She was given counselling on how to budget how to manage her time
E,and the association also arranged tuition for her son
E,As a result she managed to manage her financial her funds better
E,and uh she requested to take off to be taken off the RAUS scheme after six months <X>
