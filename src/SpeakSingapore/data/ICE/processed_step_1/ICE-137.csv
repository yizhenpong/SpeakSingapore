A,The committee however recognised the limitations of using the C P I to measure the cost of living
A,It proposed two key refinements
A,One to have three C P Is for different income groups and two that imputed rentals used for measuring housing cost be brought more closely in line with market rentals
A,Now to elaborate I have uh Deputy Director with the Institute of Policy Studies economist Doctor Lee Tsao Yuan and nominated M P Mister Chia Shi Teck
A,Good evening why don't we look straight away at this question of uh how housing is computed and put into the uh C P I because this is the one area that the committee uh specifically mentioned and one might say even criticise
A,Now why is this such a difficult issue
B,It's a very difficult issue because one wants to actually capture in some ways the consumption that one gets out of housing rather than housing as an investment per say So actually one of the best methodologies used is really this imputed rental concept The difficulty though with that in Singapore is that eighty-seven per cent of households in Singapore own their own homes So then the question is how does one then impute rent to actually a house which is actually lived in by its owners
B,And that is the difficulty for public housing
B,So that is why the committee has recommended that actually the imputed rental computation be improved
C,Okay how are they gonna do this uhm I mean what is the real problem that uh according to the report you used H D B prices
B,Rental prices
C,Uhm for housing rental price
B,Yes but the thing is that these rental prices actually are applicable to those flats which are actually rented out which are smaller flats like one-room two-room flats they're not the three room four-room flats that the majority of Singaporeans live in nowadays
B,So while private housing I think it's fairly well taken care of because there is actually quite a good rental market for private pricing but when one comes to public housing then I think there is some difficulty
B,So it is hoped that actually the authorities can do something about improving this measure
C,Okay now
D,I thought the committee sorry did uh look the private sector's uh rental prices and try to compute it and the uh effect is rather small
D,But here we we must add because of the eighty-seven per cent the home ownership in Singapore it is unique in its own right and we are looking at the uh investment side of the housing taking the fact that the property values will go up
D,But what if the value comes down
D,I think that would be uh how would it be taken as a consumption
D,I think that is the point
C,Okay that's one issue Now are there any other limitations with the C P I as an index
C,Shi Teck
D,Yah I think the C P I is a general uh indicator
D,It doesn't a a person or a family at any point in time say if you're buying a house or if you're buying a car your C your car is due for new C O E then the impact on you will be higher
D,Or you are you have aged parents or you have students that go to universities so your feeling of the cost of living that has gone up is much higher than the general indicator
D,So the C P I should be take taken as a general indicator and it has its limitations
C,Now
B,I think uh David if I may add to that
B,I think that the the one important question that we need to settle here is what does the C P I actually measure
C,Right
B,I think most Singaporeans are really thinking of a cost of living index
B,For example if they take a bowl of noodles in a hawker centre and then they also take a bowl of noodles in a noodle house
B,Where the C P I is concerned those are actually two different items altogether
B,And therefore it's not so much just the price change alone but also a quality change which the cost of living index measures
B,But a C P I measures very strictly only the price change and not the quality change
C,Okay now one other issue is the whole question of weightage
C,Uhm in a separate minority report committee member Lau Teir Kiang uh said that the C P I is deficient in some respects because the weightage given to some key items like medical care education housing and cars and and private transport does not reflect recent changes in government policy
C,Now have these changes had a major impact on household expenditure
B,I think we will really only know when we get the result of the ninety-two ninety-three household expenditure survey
B,Having said that however based on past experience in comparing the eighty-seven eighty-eight expenditure survey with that of eighty-two eighty-three there were only minor changes and it really resulted in just small changes in the C P I
C,Now does that
D,As I said the impact on the particular family or person is dependent on the person's uh spending pattern or the person's habit at that point in time
D,If you have aged parents that need to go to hospital and all of a sudden you are hit
C,Well does this therefore render the current weightage irrelevant
D,No the weightage is relevant but the person that is affected at any point in time may not be the time
D,You you're talking about general indicator and that's why the committee actually dealt in the four key E area to to zero in on what actually is uh worrying people
C,Okay but then why do you want to to go to the ninety-two ninety-three uhm survey household survey
B,Because that will that will probably have weights which are more relevant to the current period
B,But having said that however my own call it suspicion or intuition as it were is that I think that there were only result in small changes in the C P I increases
C,But but you will make it more you'll bring it more up-to-date
C,Now very quickly in in writing the report as you were one of key uh persons in writing the report were there any issues in which uh you had difficulties sort of gaining consensus
B,Yes I think we had difficulties with regards to housing and I think Shi Teck had a lot to say about housing for instance
C,Just housing
D,I think more than housing
D,Yes I think you were saying earlier we we must not take C P I to represent everything
D,The basket must be there because we spend on all kinds of things and the weightage is given to the kind uh to to the importance
D,But what affects us may be one particular item and that we we have forgotten we just look zero on our item and thing that the cost of everything has gone up in in that particular
C,Okay we'll come back with further discussion on on the report
C,We gonna take a break now
C,When we come we look at the committee's findings on cost increases in housing education health and transport
C,Higher expectations versus higher costs
C,Singaporeans want more of the good life which does not come cheap in a country facing scare resources
C,How can two seemingly opposing factors be reconciled
C,Uhm Shi Teck want do you think
D,I think first and foremost we must accept the fact that there are limitations and there is a price to pay
D,So the government's role basically is the lower income group is the affordability so to make sure that people can afford to buy the roof over their head and they can afford to fall sick
D,But uh for those who are looking for a dream homes then they would have to work for it and the that is where we have to accept the fact that there are limitations
C,Yes now you
C,I think the key question here is the extend to which government uh policies and government actions actually raise the cost of these items
C,To what extend does this happen
B,I think of the four factors mentioned if I were to actually order them in terms of priority
B,I would think that the two most important would be first scarce resources rapid economic growth
B,If it were not for the recession I think in eighty-five eighty-six I think cost would have risen much more so rapid economic growth is very important Second I would think that expectations upgrading the desire for a better quality of life
B,If you add to that the fact of the timing of the fee increases that bunched everything up together
B,It doesn't mean actually though that these cost increases would not have occurred
B,And also the reduction of subsidy rates I think is also another important factor but that is I think a much more fundamental ideological question and I agree with the government's stand that we should not adopt hefty social welfare policies
D,But even the limitations uh Da David cost must go up
D,So now the question is what kind of policies we must adopt to ensure that the cost don't go out of the reach of the people because it's not just the lower uh group of people
D,There are people who want to aspire it will it would be the dream that actually motivate them to work further
D,Imagine that you you can never own a house then nobody will want to work anymore
D,So I think it is the the control and maybe certain kind of a a assistance should be uh looked in in the kind of the policies we have
D,I I don't buy that everything should be left to market forces because given the limitations there's just no market forces to determinate
D,The land is scarce you can corner up the land or the people in the car industry must buy up the C O Es because they got to sell cars
D,So that itself is already uh clear that it's not a open uh market forces
D,So with that in mind we have to move and uh uh manipulate a little
C,Well what can the government do about the rate of these price increases
B,I think one of the main things is still back to productivity increases
B,There no way around it or else we will definitely get a wage price spiral higher prices higher wages leading to higher prices and so on
D,I think I agree
D,But on the other hand is government departments should not be run as business corporations
D,Their job is to facilitate their job is not to make money so if if taken off their head then I think the cost itself need not go up uh that quickly For instance we accept that the land is scarce and that it should go with the market price
D,But remembering that we acquire the land or the government's cost of land is much lower so and land is a big factor to to uh the cost of housing
D,So whether the land need to be pushed to such a high price
C,Are we asking people to lower moderate their expectations
D,Yes we have to accept the fact that there are limitations and we must work
D,It's alright to want to drive big cars and live in big houses but you got to work for it
D,I think that part we have to accept and the government is not here as a Santa Claus no government can continue to be Santa Clauses
C,Is it legitimate for people of the lower or the middle uh classes to fear that these costs will increase to such an extend as to make them unaffordable
B,I think that we examine actually this question in detail and I think that we did come to the conclusion that in terms of affordability that basic housing basic health care basic education and transportation et cetera are indeed affordable
B,But if you want that bit more than as Shi Teck has pointed out you've got to earn it <X>
C,There is there seems to be an inevitablity in uh the rise of of prices of some of these scare commodities especially things like housing and cars which are the two things that that most people aspire to Is it do we just have to throw our hands up in the air and say well this is evitable we can't help it
D,No I think the the alternatives are important as I mentioned earlier If the public transportation is improved such that it's so efficient on or the other hand if you live with no road control system the roads will be choked that nobody will want to drive anyway So you either leave it you know and and let the natural course take its place or you have some uh regulation some control So it's it's not a a and or kind of thing it's all in our mind you know If you go to Hong Kong big tycoons are taking M R Ts so it's a livestyle So I think we we can uh improve Alternatives are important or in a health care do you need to go to a one-room with television air-conditioned and all the frills or is it more important to ensure that the proper medical attention is given And that itself can be made affordable
C,Now which of these uh items did the committee consider to be of most concern education housing transport uhm
B,All of them
D,I think all the four
C,All of them equally equally uh important
B,Yah yes but I think that it is also important they want to consider cost increases To think about income increases as well And if you look at the perspective of let's say the last ten years I think incomes have risen faster than cost Standards of living have indeed improved
D,And I think that that's one thing that the Singaporeans must uh pay tribute to the government I mean all of us have actually improved in the quality of life
C,Uh Shi Teck Yuan thank you very much for sharing your views with us and for being on Moneymind </X> </I>
