A,Okay then the ah never going to get my things done
B,What things
A,Uh aiyah all my <unclear> word </unclear> fifteen minutes
B,The the the life scripts
A,Beng Chiak is very upset just now
B,I don't blame her
A,Ya
A,She was I've never seen her so
A,When she get upset uh
B,She want to break down and cry right
A,If she get upset she'll like 'Yes you want talk to me'
B,Ya uhm
A,No why I'm why I'm annoyed about is that when I spoke to Enita
B,Enita
A,She said she doesn't want to do it so okay fine
A,Uhm she said then she said like actually Shoberth can do it but it's just that they didn't communicate properly and all that with Beng Kiang all that
A,I said Whatever
A,Then I said
A,Then she explained
A,I said No you don't have to explain
A,I I'll just do it
A,She said Why are you not upset
A,I said Well I'd rather not get emotional about these things
A,I I'll just be functional and and and detached and practical
A,Then she said like Okay that's good
A,Then uhm she said Will you call Beng Kiang
A,I said I will call Beng Kiang but not to tell her that you don't want to do it but I think you should call her and tell her that you don't want to do it
A,But I'll call Beng Kiang later and just talk about
A,Okay so now what we do
A,But what I'm most annoyed about is that she called Beng Kiang and she told Beng Kiang
B,To call
A,That I will talk to her you know and said Beng Kiang called me <unclear> word </unclear>
A,Yes you want to talk to me
A,I said uhm Ya did Enita call you
A,Said she said Yes
A,Then I said uhm so did did she tell you she can't do it
A,She said Yes so you want to talk to me about what
A,You know like uh
A,Ya I thought we know you'd better talk about what other possibilites there are and all that kind of thing
B,No what what I was really annoyed with Enita was was okay she she she blamed Beng Kiang for the Shobun thing
B,You know what I mean
A,Ya
B,As in like it's it's uhm uhm they never communicate
B,She never explain properly to her and now because at the end of the day <unclear> word </unclear>
B,What it means is Enita cannot go on holiday
B,You know what I mean or not
B,I can't help thinking that even if she's concerned about Shobun
B,I can't help thinking that that that at the end of the day it's because if or or it doesn't work out she cannot go on holiday
A,Ya
B,You know is it and this is very irritating because it's irres
B,I still feel it's irres(irresponsible)
B,That's why she doesn't want to talk to me about it you see
B,Because I told her yesterday I think you should do it
A,No but I don't want to be
A,I don't want to like tell people you must do you must not do
A,If you don't want to do don't do just say No or Yes
A,I don't want to even hear reasons because you are adult enough to to to to go and rationalize this and you know
B,Ya
B,No no
B,Because the thing is that why why I felt that uhm one of us had to say it was because uhm on Beng Kiang's behalf you see because I think Beng Kiang felt that it's it's very difficult
B,Because Beng Kiang will feel that at the end of the day that we didn't we didn't uhm tsk do anything about it
A,No but these things you just have to like live with it kind
A,I mean look at Those who can't teach wants his face pulled out like two weeks before like what I mean you go to him and you say No you must not leave that kind of thing <unclear> word </unclear>
A,I think you should stay and all that
B,No that's different you see but then you see that's different because you you are involved in it
B,Alvin's involved in it and we explained blah blah blah blah right
B,The problem with this Beng Kiang thing is that it's Enita you see
B,Enita is supposed to be one of us kind of thing and at and while while we we receive <unclear> word </unclear> production support and all that
B,Then it's like Beng Kiang says ya
B,Uhm you know she asked me that day Is is Enita always like that
B,Does she do this very often
B,I said No as far as I know
B,I said she she does have some time constraints and stuff
B,That's why in in reference to the group she's very clear about it
B,She she cannot come for this she cannot come for that
B,It's okay you see
A,Ya
B,But she's clear from the onstart
B,But I said I guess this is an unusual circumstance because she also didn't expect to be here <unclear> word </unclear>
B,To be given the luxury of leave suddenly you see
B,You know what I mean
B,But then it's like if we all if we if we don't say that uhm you have a responsibility to do it then it's like we are being lax you see
B,You know what I mean
A,Ya
B,And it's not as if we're offering a lot of of of uhm uhm alternatives to Beng Kiang
A,Ya
B,It's it's at this moment we're very stretched for <unclear> word </unclear> as if we have <unclear> word </unclear>
B,And I told I told Enita there
B,And then I said I said I I have to admit
B,My main priority at that point <unclear> word </unclear> one week ago is is uhm Dawn
B,Because Dawn hasn't even started you see and and the way Enita put it is like Okay so the script is not written yet you know so it's alright if I pull out
B,It's not true you see and I I so I told Beng Kiang I know why she's very panicky
B,So I said let's
B,I I told Beng Kiang that day in in the that uhm shop
B,Even if it's not Enita if it's Shoberth whoever
B,I said Your main priority now is to is to polish up the cast and get the show on the road because she said Ya then the script <unclear> word </unclear> in the script will be <unclear> word </unclear> and all that
B,I said But
B,I said This is the is you know for the audience
B,You you want the audience <unclear> word </unclear> to find out whether it's going to be a good script or not right
B,So you must like you
B,You can't give <unclear> word </unclear> make house situation <unclear> word </unclear> where everybody says Aiyah don't know
B,This part didn't work
B,Don't know whether it's the cast the director or the or the script kind of thing
A,Ya
B,So I said if the direction is good and the the cast is good then at least we can say Ah okay it's the script
B,This is the problem where but that's constructive you see
B,So ya lah that's why
A,So now we just meet someone who is free for two weeks and who is good and who can just can just do it
B,Ya but that's easier said than done
A,Tomorrow morning lah
A,What's happening tomorrow morning
A,About just <unclear> word </unclear> <X>
B,Okay No that's why I'm very I'm very I'm very uhm confused right now about this because it's like do we do we find someone for her or is Shoberth doing it or what
A,No she said she'll go and talk to Shoberth and Beng Kiang Beng Kiang and if Shoberth can't do it then we'll find someone lah
B,Okay so <unclear> word </unclear>
A,I told her I said I will ask Kah Wai She said no it's not a role for Kah Wai I said okay Then we just have to think of someone
B,Jowee
A,Uh
B,Cos'
A,Ah ya actually it's something Jowee can do seriously but we have to ask her lah but I don't want I rather do
B,I don't want another one of these another 'I did you a favour You owe me one <unclear> word </unclear> '
A,Ya ya
B,How
A,Uh Let's hope <unclear> word </unclear> okay we go out we're going where are we going <&>  lauhs </&> We're going to eat at Environment Building ah
B,I don't mind I haven't eaten there for the whole week You all have right
A,Ya no I don't mind There's a lot of food stalls there
