E,*giggle* Yucks
D,*slurp* Damn nice
D,Want some
E,Don't want
E,Eee I don't take beef
D,Why
E,I don't take beef means I don't take beef
D,Religious reasons
E,Uhm
D,But that doesn't make sense
D,Hinduism never </{> <[> stipulated that you cannot </[> eat beef
E,<[> Shut up <unclear> word </unclear> </[> </{>
D,Hinduism never stipulated that you cannot eat beef
E,it did
D,Where
E,I don't know lah
E,Just shut up lah
D,You see it's a cultural concept
D,Wait
D,It's not fair
D,You see ah beef was probably not to be eaten in the Indian culture because cow gives milk
D,And milk is also given by the mother
D,And therefore cows were compared as sacred to mothers
D,And that's why they say you shouldn't eat cows
D,It's got no religious connotations
E,Yah it is associated with Siva what
D,No
D,Siva himself is just a construct because humans were not able to focus on a particular point
E,Uh uhm
D,They cannot pray to the formless So humans created for themselves forms
D,Alright Therefore just
D,Siva is just a fictitious thing from the mind
E,Oh I see
D,And there is only one God ain't that right'
E,Yah
D,Yah and so there is no Shiva
E,so you should be able to eat beef
E,Well I've been brought up that way
D,No but since it defies logic so you should <{> <[> start eating beef now </[>
E,<[> Uh no I don't want </[> </{>
E,Don't like
D,Because you don't like <{> <[> Now that's a </[> different reason altogether
E,<[> No no no </[> </{>
E,I've been brought up that way
D,Yah so now you're not eating beef because you don't <{> <[> like it </[>
E,<[> Maybe </[> </{>
D,Maybe
E,Maybe yah
D,So it is not a religious reason <{> <[> anymore </[>
E,<[> Maybe it is still </[> </{>
D,Why
E,it is lah
D,Why
D,Where is the logic
E,No there is a logic
D,Are you saying Hinduism <{> <[> is not logical </[>
E,<[> <unclear> word </unclear> </[> </{>
E,No it is
D,<unclear> word </unclear> it is
E,It is
E,I'll think of an answer and tell it to you by tonight
E,I just cannot get my words straight <X>
D,<[> You are vegetarian on Thursdays right You are vegetarian on Thursdays right
E,Yah <unclear> word </unclear>
D,Why
E,Uh mm because I'm training myself to become a full vegetarian
D,Why full vegetarian
E,Because I don't like killing animals lah
D,What's the difference between an animal and a vegetarian and a vegetable
E,What do you mean
D,When you uproot <[> a carrot it's actually being killed as well
E,<[> <unclear> word </unclear> actually I don't like eating flesh <unclear> word </unclear>
D,So it's due to a lack of liking that you don't eat flesh
E,Uh what lack of liking
D,Yah
E,Yah
D,Then why aren't you a full-fledged vegetarian then
E,Aah Yah soon
D,Soon so why are you eating meat now
E,Uh because I've always been eating meat So I can't <[> like
D,<[> So you like it
E,of course I like it
D,Just now you said that you don't eat meat because you don't like it
E,Because I don't like it because I don't like the idea of
D,Killing an animal
E,Animal and
D,And I asked you
E,No more eating flesh because there's a lot of problem
D,That - you didn't say earlier but let's get back to it anyway
E,<unclear> word </unclear>
D,You said you don't eat meat because you like vegetables and that was your reason Now you're saying earlier you said you don't wanna kill animals because you don't wanna kill animals right
E,Uh huh yah
D,And I said when you uproot a carrot the carrot dies also And then you state you said that you don't like the taste of meat
E,Mm
D,But you're eating meat now And you say you've been brought up that way
E,I'm sorry I'm lost
D,ok let's get start again <[> Why are you vegetarian
E,<[> No need no need
D,No I'm not gonna give up
E,No need <&>  x4)
D,No you see you must do things with logic
E,Yah
D,ok and Hinduism is perfectly a logical religion
E,Yah it is
D,You're going to
E,I never denied that fact
D,Yah so why you're not eating beef
E,What beef I don't like to eat beef ok
D,ok lah ok lah you don't like
E,Yah
D,But there is no religious connotations to not eating beef right
E,There is
D,so if I eat beef I'm not a good Hindu is it
E,I never said that what
D,But you're saying Hinduism says that you should not eat beef Answer answer
E,No answer I answer <[> tonight
D,<[> So you should start eating beef
