A,Okay the rest came this morning right
A,Take the nine o'clock one is it 'cos normally it should be the other way round
A,You got two classes nine and ten usually it's the ten that's full and nine is empty
A,These people can't wake up in time
A,Yes just now the nine o'clock class is more than full about seventeen
A,Okay right now questions one and two any problems with those
A,Okay any problem with those
A,Question one we have the application and s matrix to <unclear> word </unclear>
A,Okay for question two question two we've to find the unitary condition
A,Any problem with that
A,No right so let's move on to questions three four and five
A,The basic uh emphasis here is to make s matrix together with all other known matrices
A,Okay for example you have t z you have other matrices like in y your h your hybrid okay
A,Now we haven't got time to cover everything so for this particular tutorial we'll just look at this t matrix and the z matrix right
A,I want you all to feel comfortable with s matrix
A,I know it's a very new matrix that uh forcing on you all but I hope that after this tutorial you'll be able to see that the s matrix is but one out of many matrices that you can use okay
A,And even if you start out with your s matrix and let's say you need to transform it to another matrix there is no problem
A,Let's say for question uh three or question four rather for question four you find that the t matrix actually is more suitable for practical application
A,There's no problem as a conversion formula between the two so you can always switch from one to the other okay
A,Right so come in come in
A,Right first of all we try to establish the relationship between the s and the t and that's our question three
A,Okay now this is your two port network
A,Now two port network you find that to assume that your symbols are of these four okay
A,With that you find that your sketching representation is just simply this okay
A,Now this way of writing things assumes that your A1 and A2 are independent parameters and your B1 and B2 are dependent parameters
A,This is not unreasonable okay
A,A network like this you ought to know what you are feeding your system with and you're interested in knowing how that system responds okay so for the s matrix that is our presumption
A,We know what we have as input and we want to know the response of the system to the input
A,Now what if your emphasis changes
A,What if you change your set of independent parameters
A,Okay so for this question we are going to look at the possibility that A2 and B2 are known right A2 and B2 are known and you're supposed to find A1 and B1
A,So in other words this becomes your independent set and this becomes your dependent set okay
A,So let's get that from this particular set
A,Alright uh it's awkward to have your left hand side comprising B1 is your dependent but this B2 is independent so let's shift B2 over to the other side and uh shift the A1 which is supposed to be dependent over to the left okay
A,So you will have right so let's re-write the familiar set of sketching equations in this form
A,Now once I write it in this form I can then assume that this is a pair of pair of simultaneous equations in two nodes
A,If my nodes are B1 A1 this whole lot on the right hand side is assumed to be known okay so in that case how to get hold of my unknowns
A,Well simultaneous equations there are lots of ways of solving it
A,Let's use your Kramer's rule okay <unclear> word </unclear> uh
A,You all have heard of Kramer's rule is it
A,Okay so this you can solve by Kramer's rule
A,Now let's I won't go through the mechanical assume that we can solve it there you find that when you end up with this set of equations
A,Okay so you'll end up with this set of equations
A,Right what's so important about this set of equations <unclear> word </unclear>
A,First thing let's change the symbols okay
A,While you're sketching parameters we chose this set of symbols because they represent certain things
A,Now since I want to look at the same system but from a different perspective I have to change the symbols
A,I let you change it to this big A1 big B1 and on this side I have big A2 big B2 okay usually written in this order
A,Now here let me fit this arrows
A,For <unclear> word </unclear> matrix we normally draw in this <unclear> word </unclear>
A,Let me fit the arrows so that they correspond
A,Okay now what do we have here
A,Right we <unclear> word </unclear> it with a if there's a one-for-one correspondence so what you want you can change to big A1 small B1 you can change to big B1 okay
A,Small B2 this red arrow here I can change to the green arrow here
A,Physically it's the same wave all I'm doing is just giving it a different name okay giving it a different symbol
A,So that means just a small B2 can can can be replaced by a big B2 and this small A1 here can be represent oh this should be 2 sorry this one can be represented by B2 okay
A,Alright uh this whole lot here can be reformatted in another form as another matrix
A,Okay and we find that if we call the new matrix t then I have okay then I have this new matrix which is your transmission matrix in that form and uh I find that uh there's a one-for-one correspondence
A,Okay if I'm given my s matrix and I got one more t matrix this one is given by this this is given by that and so on okay
A,So here we have uh s matrix is given you want to transform it to the t matrix quite simple your t matrix is just simply given by one over s21 it's all over there
A,Right any questions
A,Any questions
A,By the way this tutorial session is being recorded and if it turns out that engineering class students do not ask questions it's going to reflect badly okay
A,So any questions
A,Come on she's taking a survey of all the faculties and uh the result will just confirm what everybody knows engineer students okay no
A,Now let's move on
G,Sir the the part three application
A,Application
G,Application ya
A,Okay <unclear> word </unclear> part three let's go part three there
A,Right now let's have a look at this particular matrix here uh this particular statement here
A,This one here is a input A1 B1 is an input A2 B2 is output okay
A,The relationship between them is a simple t
A,Now what if I have a whole string of boxes let's just draw more boxes
A,Okay now this one let's say I have a t1 matrix this one has a t2 matrix
A,Right the input here is related to this output via a t1 matrix but this output cannot be an input to the second system okay
A,So this one will be related to another output A3 B3 via a t2 okay
A,So the application of this is if I have a loads cascade of networks I find that this is a very powerful way of handling things
A,Right if there is a total of said n such boxes then all I need to do is take the product of all n of them and I can straightaway get hold of my input for whatever output regardless of the number of stages I need to <unclear> word </unclear>
A,Okay and for filter design you know those that uh you sometimes need a whole string of stages <unclear> word </unclear>
A,Filter design not amplifier design okay
H,So in fact this uh is uh kind of a there's a correspondence to the ABC matrix in the
A,Because of ABC matrix because of ABC matrix <unclear> word </unclear> something like ABC matrix you <unclear> word </unclear> follow the transmission matrix right
A,I know <unclear> word </unclear> is what textbooks like to use but uh it's a very clumsy of calling <unclear> word </unclear>
A,Right different matrices will have different features that is what is remember that for question our sub-question b okay so let's look at part b
A,Now part b asks us to look at the system when it's reciprocal okay
A,When does the system cease to be reciprocal
A,Come on I've already taught I've already asked you all during lecture uh plus plus any others
I,Active elements
A,Active elements
A,Some more
J,Byrex
A,Byrex okay
A,Most the majority of the systems will be reciprocal the only exceptions are onyl plus plus byrex active elements okay
A,If you don't have these three the likelihood of it being reciprocal is very strong
A,Now for the s matrix it's very easy to spot whether the system is reciprocal or not just look for the off diagonal elements okay
A,If the off diagonal elements are equal that's it the system is reciprocal T matrix however more work but t matrix you find that if you're to check whether your system is reciprocal you have to get hold of the determinant okay
A,Now why
A,Well here just go to the analysis to see why
A,Right that is your determinant
A,You have all the elements already
A,You are off here so that's perfect then
A,Right uh this okay
A,Right this is your thing that's question correct uh things that we cancel out so it becomes easier
A,This one cancels with this so what we're left with is this
A,It's s21 here it's s21 squared here so we'll get rid of s21 uh we're left with that okay
A,Now we're told that the system is reciprocal which means that the s12 will be equal to s1 so that means this will be one okay so this is your check
A,If you have a s matrix it's simple just the check is just a visual check okay but if you're working on t matrix there's a little bit more work you have to form the determinant
A,See if the determinant is one if it's given t then you can conclude that your system is reciprocal okay if it's not that means you have one of those three elements in there byrex active elements or plus plus okay
A,Any question No let's move on to question four
A,This question three sets the background and answers for it
A,Now let's actually apply it to a circuit given in question four
A,Right question four you have this system
A,The first matrix is sigma 'A'
A,sorry second matrix is sigma
A,What about sketching matrices
A,We're told that uh this your first cascade second cascade and then finally you have to load okay
A,These are all boxes but your load could be in this box here could be in the antenna right your antenna is radiating away
A,This one this box here could be uh a filter network you want to make sure that only certain signals get sent all the other frequencies are filtered out
A,This one here could be amplifier network okay
A,You want to make sure you pump enough signal uh pump enough power for the antenna to radiate out right <X>
A,So all these boxes are typical things that you need to put in for particular system to work right Question is if here you have a load just put in the arrows if here you have a load such that your A just a minute A3 B3 if here you have a load such that B3 <unclear> word </unclear> three <unclear> word </unclear> gamma L you'll be very interested to know what is my gamma in here The gamma in is uh B1 over A1 okay A typical situation will be like this This is your load you go through a series of cas uuh network over here you want to hook it up to a source you want to check that your load is not going to heavily affect the source operation okay So this is a typical problem I want to work out what gamma in is For gamma L after it has gone through a series of boxes Right <unclear> word </unclear> in this case you find that uh your transmission matrix is not powerful than your sketching matrix okay Alright uh your A1 B1 which you're interested in because that is where your source is you want to know what is happening to it Let's say this can be transformed to T' this can be transformed T'' you want to know what is happening to <unclear> word </unclear> at the other port okay So that will give you this this one can then be related to your other port okay So that is what we have Now let's give this a composite name this is a product here let's give it a composite symbol of t So that means what I have is A1 is equals to t11 A3 plus t2 B3 B1 okay That's what I'm going to have The right hand side here there are two symbols two parameters A3 and B3 However we learn that the load is somewhere else so the two of them are related in that case B3 is just straightforwardly this okay So if I want gam gamma A simple take this row divide by that row and straightaway I have the answer okay Right now that's your answer in terms of the composite matrix t However we still got to get hold of T' and T'' okay So that's our next step get hold of T' and T'' Right t will be T' times uh T'' What is T' From question two uh sorry question three from question three we've already established that uh okay T' ought to be that T'' simple it's exactly the same uh except for a change of symbols right Now you can take the product of it uh straightforwardly by that but uh let's start making use of the approximations Okay return the product you find that you are uh you have quite a whole long of unwieldy string of uh terms but instead of doing that let's look at the situation where skk here is small okay where sigma kk here is small </X> </I>
