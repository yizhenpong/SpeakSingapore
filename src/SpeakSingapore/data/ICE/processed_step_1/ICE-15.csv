A,So uhm now I've three draughtsmen right
A,I have Siew Kiau Emily uh Siew Kiau Emily
B,Diana
A,Ah Diana and then Thomas for the editing
A,So what I ask them to do is Simon had already given me the list of <unclear> word </unclear>
A,Uh what what they have submitted you know to the authorities and what they have produced so far lah
A,So next week we can arrange <unclear> word </unclear> to discuss about that
B,Ya
B,'Think the problem now is really to see how far they have managed to go with the different drawings that they have to do
A,Uhm I now uh
A,Diana is doing all the <unclear> word </unclear> submission drawings
A,She's already finishing up you know uh amending the drawings to fit <unclear> word </unclear> requirements uh
A,So she's doing it manual not on computer and uh Diana is now doing for me all the drawings for the the contractor the diaphragm more openings
A,So she's clearing up that lot and then Emily is doing elevation drawings with the pre-cast panels four by four work out all the dimensions how far
B,Uhm
A,From the coluhmn grid and so on and also I uh the sewage now the sewage reply has come back she has to do updating
B,Uhm
A,in the computer
B,So how do you think Tom can help to sort of vet the drawings or uh sort of help you in the detailing of some of these things
B,Because I think at the moment he does seem to feel a bit difficult uh problems in in co-ordinating some of these drawings
A,Is it
A,He didn't fill a form
B,Because I I I think the problem also partly because of this computer drawing thing you know
A,Ah
B,Because we had we can't get a feel of what are the the drawings in the computer
A,What I've asked him to do so far is like for instance the sewage unit uh once the reply came back
B,Uhm
A,uh I I made some comments on the reply by by sewage right
A,Then I ask uh him to look through and discuss with Emily
A,So he looked through Emily's set of drawings and discussed how the requirements uh can be met nuh
A,So uh he also went down with Emily to see the offices in Environment
B,Uhm
A,to discuss about their requirement whether we can do it or not or is it cost costing a problem and so on
B,Ya
A,So that is the technical part I think he can help me do you know
B,Ya
A,all these nitty gritty detail things
A,So uhm it's the same for like the contractor drawings uh
B,Uhm
A,Because he's got more technical knowledge for the actual construction
B,Uhm
A,So if that's true he ask Diana to help draw up all these things uh
B,So has he managed to get onto that yet
A,Ya he's doing that now but what what I find problem is he's he has not enough time also you know
B,Ya
A,So when whenever I ask him he may not do it promptly
B,Oh
A,he said do it later
B,Ya
A,So like the diaphragm mode we are a bit behind time giving information
B,Uhm ya
A,Ya
B,I think that's why we are sort of discussing to see what of any of the other work he can uh sort of delegate to other people so that he can have more time for your project
A,When you say continue working drawing you mean uhm they consult him on the detailing or he just checks the drawing
B,I think that he has to I think it would be better if he could really co-ordinate all the drawings so that uh because certain problems which occur on other projects he can sort of make sure that it doesn't recur in this one Things like that and the amount of detailing you know
B,Because I think for us uhm you I think you'll you need to do a lot more design work right
A,Uhm
B,So a lot of these details in a way is probably like wasting your time if you have to go and give all the details to the draughtsmen
B,So this type of things if he can help to
A,Uhm
B,give instructions to to them
A,Uhm uhm like even like uh now I get the set of drawings from structure <unclear> word </unclear> from contractor drawing <unclear> word </unclear> there's slight difference
A,There's a lot of checking to be done
B,Uhm yes yes
A,uh to check against our architectural drawings for discrepancies
B,Uhm
A,So uhm
B,Yes some of those if he can
A,whether he will be the one actually doing it or he should have he will as eh de designate and allocate duties to the rest
B,I think those type of details if the draughtsman who is doing the actual drawing of say the rises
A,Uhm
B,They probably uh know the details of the rises sort of better
B,So maybe the the TO themselves can can check some of those type of details
B,But those things which are like okay staircase details and those floor plans sections and all that
A,Uhm
B,I think Tom can help to just check that what they've drawn
A,Uhm
B,is sort of practical or you know
B,Any uhm detailing things that they've to look out for
A,Uhm
B,And uhm I don't know perhaps we should also look into what we can use standard drawings
A,Uhm
B,See what other things whether there are any standard drawings that you can sort of incorporate
A,Uhm
B,Rather than having to
A,Actually now they're not really getting into details yet you know
A,It's it's still overall plan and getting levels correct
B,Uhm
A,Floor like staircase trap riser and landing levels floor <unclear> word </unclear> levels
B,Uhm
A,And then the riser opening shifting the beams and all these things
B,Okay Uhm
A,Ya
B,But I think we have to already start on the details right
B,Because or else uhm August is very close
A,I know like I I
B,Ya
A,try to list like
B,Ya
A,There's one thousand and one drawings to do you know
B,That's right
A,How to finish you know
B,Ya that's right ya
B,I don't know
B,Hopefully with the new drauhtsmen coming in for CMB I don't know whether we can use any uh to produce whether there they can help us or not
A,Can we use their resources
B,I think if if they are not uh I don't know whether they need <unclear> word </unclear> straightaway now or not
A,Uhm
B,whether we can help whether they can help to do something for us first
A,Uhm
B,Because our timing is a bit ahead of theirs right
A,Uhm
B,So it'll be something we have to discuss with the LAM side uh
A,Uhm
B,You want to talk anything more interesting
A,Ya the D and D
A,Uh Janet is going to be my stage manager
A,So
B,Uhm
A,Have you got the tape uh
B,I can't I can't recall having it you know
B,I've asked you to check with Nina
A,Huh
B,Because uh she was handling the thing
A,Because Jin Jin said uh she returned the tape to you
A,Jin Jin was the one who did the taping of the Friday Background and said uh news opening piece
B,Uh I've to go through
A,So last night I tried
A,I taped the news and then I did a narration of the opening scene
A,Uh then after that I was supposed to tape Friday Background
A,You know then my sister her stupid watch was slow by five minutes
A,So I I was talking
B,So you were with her and a friend
A,so by the time I went and <unclear> word </unclear> the TV the uh hey uh opening scene music was gone
A,So I tape the ending of Friday Background the music
A,I'm not sure if it's the same as the opening music
B,Ha
B,I can't recall
B,I'll go through whatever tape I can find
A,Uh
B,But I can't recall if I had it what I would have done with it you see
A,Uhm
B,But uh I think in fact they had it on different tapes is it
B,Because I taped the voice myself
A,Oh
B,That was
A,Oh you did the newsreading
B,I did the newsreading
A,Uhm
B,But I think I did I tape onto that
B,I can't remember
B,Maybe I did
B,Uh I can't remember
B,I'll I'll
A,You see if you can find lah
B,Ya
A,If not I'll just use whatever I've taped you know
B,Uhm
A,It's just that the Friday Background only comes like I think every two weeks right
B,One <unclear> word </unclear>
B,Is it two weeks
A,I think it's every two week you know
B,I thought there's only one
A,Then there's Contact-Y then there's Feed
A,Oh yes every two weeks there's Feedback fortnightly
B,Oh
A,Feedback and then Friday Background
A,Feedback Friday
A,It'll be too late next week

B,Ya ya ya ya
A,So he's she's doing stage management
A,Now he's going to collect all the props for me lah
B,Uhm
A,The only problem we have is like <unclear> word </unclear> I forgot to call Mandarin
A,Uh to ask them whether they have a whiteboard and a flip chart
A,We want to mount the you know the carpark sign on the
B,Uhm uhm uhm
A,flip chart you know
B,Ya
A,And then use their whiteboard to pin up the world map
B,I thought flip chart flip chart we can still bring but whiteboard will be rather big quite difficult
B,I think they should have uh because
A,We don't have a flip chart
A,They what they use last time was a a smaller whiteboard y' know which is still quite high
B,Uhm
A,on castors
A,I don't think we can put that into her car
B,I think Mandarin should have lah because they organise seminars
A,<unclear> word </unclear>
B,<unclear> word </unclear> seminars
A,Ya I think they should have flip chart
B,So they should have
A,So these are the only two things uh that Mandarin has to provide lah
A,The rest we can bring right
B,Uhm
A,Prop uh costuhmes and uh what else huh
A,The guns and all that
B,Have they given you the stage layout
A,No I think I shall ask from them
B,Ya because in case they have the big uhm sound mixers and all that
B,The deejays equipment
A,Ya
B,May be blocking
A,Don't know if they show that on the layout
B,Then they will have to check with the <unclear> word </unclear>
A,Huh
A,Thursday we have rehearsal
A,They slotted us on Thursday
B,On stage is it
A,Ya at Mandarin
B,Okay because the last time when we had the other show remember we had to discuss with Victor Khoo where he was going to put all his deejay desk and all that

A,Can't stand her
A,She just wrote a letter to Mandarin you know
B,Who is this woman
