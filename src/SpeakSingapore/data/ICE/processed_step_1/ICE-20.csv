A,But I have to make
B,slides uh
A,Ya look

B,That time you have already what
B,Those slides that you have
A,Ya but they're totally different
A,This time you have to make slides for for gels stuff like that
B,with the results and so on
B,I think there's a lot of work involved uh
A,Ya
A,But can I make it less than eight minutes uh
A,But even now I say down here at eight minutes
B,I think seven six minutes should be quite alright lah
A,Five minutes
B,Five minutes maybe too short you know
B,Five minutes is only about sixty percent of the time only
B,If seven eight minutes I think should be alright
B,Uh
B,No I think you definitely got more things to talk about isn't it
A,I don't want to talk too much because I've told you I've got <unclear> word </unclear> in August
B,You got slides and so on
B,You've got another one in August
A,I've got another one in August
A,So I don't want I don't want to talk too much because <unclear> word </unclear>
B,I thought that time you submitted a poster session
B,So you just put posters and then just stand around you know
A,The thing is I think they are the ones who decide
B,Oh they decide so
A,That is most
B,Ya lah
B,Good lah
B,Maybe they find that it's very interesting isn't
A,Please lah I am not
B,It's probably very new
B,So they are quite eager to find out more
A,I think it's because of Alan Potter
A,What do you think
B,Is he in the committee
A,What do you think
A,Uh it's IM it's organized by IMCB
B,Ya provided he's sitting in the committee uh
A,No he's not
A,I don't think so then
A,I don't think so
A,I ask I'll ask this who uh Keng Chong uh
A,First can we change ask him to change to posters
A,Seriously
B,Change it to poster uh
A,Ya what about that
B,Ya maybe you can try
A,You can try is it
B,You can try uh
A,I all along I assume it's a poster you know
B,Ya I thought it's a poster too
B,That's what you said isn't it
B,It's outside that LT down there the canteen there
A,Ya ya ya ya
B,And then just put your poster there and then just stand around lah
A,Ya ya ya ya ya <unclear> word </unclear>
B,And then ah ah
A,Ya
A,I'll ask Keng Chong about it uh
A,How's that
B,Uhm
A,Oh another thing
B,How about Keng Chong
B,Did he receive this already
A,He receive
A,I don't know I'm going to ask him then
B,Oh maybe his is a a poster or
A,So I can swop with him you mean
B,You can swop with him
B,Uh or if his is a talk then too bad lah you know
B,I think it maybe quite difficult you know because they already allocated the time everything for you already
B,So it's quite difficult for you to withdraw like that
A,Why aiyah stupid me lah
A,Then
B,But the good thing is a talk you just go there and then finish up the whole thing
B,Eight minutes you see
B,Because poster I think you have to stand there for the whole day and so on right
B,You never know whether
A,Come on a talk I would have known <unclear> word </unclear>
A,I <unclear> word </unclear>
A,I'll stutter all the way
B,Well imagine Kenneth Mark down there can already what
A,Please he won't be back that's why I hope he'll back before then
B,No give you moral support uh
A,But then I don't think so really

A,You just like to slime me right
B,Who is this person uh

B,Then he got some friends there
B,Then when they wrote back Singapore actually went to India you know before he get he got to receive the letter
A,But I can see uh from this person this person is a
A,Never mind I'll ask Keng Chong about it anyway
B,Oh
B,Good lah interesting what
B,Good experience
A,'A' ask you something uh
B,But the thing is then you have to do duplicate uhm more work uh because if this is a slide you have to do slides
A,Huh
B,And then over in US <unclear> word </unclear> would be a poster then you have to do another poster
A,Ya that's why
B,Because if this' poster then you just do one for both uh
A,Who says so

A,He's only a perfectionist when it comes to work okay
A,When it comes to his house his room it's different
B,Why
B,Very untidy uh
A,I tell you everything is all over you know where he's to search then he's got to take out this and
B,So you're you're must settle down fast
A,I'm not going to do his laundry or tidy up his room for him
A,And anyway he says he's the kind who wants <unclear> word </unclear> not to be tidied so he he knows where is it in his untidy position
B,No different uh
B,Before he get married probably he said this
B,After he get married he want everything to be spick and span lah
A,Are you sure
B,Ya I think so uh
A,That's you okay
