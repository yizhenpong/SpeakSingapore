A,What did you what did you think about it
B,I think I never expected it to happen you know because uh I always thought to myself that the MRT was perfectly safe and all that
B,But I was so surprised to hear that that you know it actually crashed okay
B,And there's a good thing that it crashed at the station and one of the trains was stationary
A,Stationary
A,That's right but that shouldn't happen if the train is stationary
A,Why should the uh moving train you know collide into
B,I think the time-table must have got mixed up
B,Maybe one train was the the the the first train was slower and second train was faster you know so somehow or rather <unclear> word </unclear> happen
B,'Cause it's quite frequent right the MRT
A,Yes I think in morning it's about three minutes intervals or something
B,Enough to crash <unclear> word </unclear> probably
A,So Boon did you take the MRT to work I mean to to
B,I stay at Eusoff College and there's a shuttle bus service
A,I see I see
A,Well I don't take the MRT I take the bus so but I take the MRT home
B,Oh now you be with
A,So hopefully it it will resume its service when at about five o'clock
B,You think people will lose faith in the MRT now that this has happened
A,I don't think so I think I think it there must be some some reason behind colli collision
A,It cannot happen just all of a sudden like
B,Probably there will be a big investigation like <unclear> word </unclear>
A,I'm sure there will
B,When the the cable-car actually came down at Sentosa there was this big in inquest right ya
B,So probably the same is gonna happen now
A,Yes yes but luckily it was I mean one of the train was stationary
A,I'm sure the the impact of collision may not have been very bad
B,Probably many of the people on on the train were students at NUS because it happened at Clementi in the morning you know
A,I suppose
B,Ya
A,But then the the the train was suppose to be heading towards Jurong
B,Ya exactly
A,So so probably more workers rather than students
B,But it stopped at Clementi you see so
B,That means the students haven't got down yet so probably
A,Oh do they normally go to Clementi Station
B,Ya many many students go to Clementi especially if they're from Arts or from Engineering right
A,I see I see
B,Ya so probably lot of NUS students involve in that crash there
A,Do you know they're gonna have it on TV at three o'clock this afternoon
B,You mean it has become a some like some celebrity
A,Not cele <unclear> word </unclear>
A,I think they they they they promise a a kind of a report on TV
A,So at three o'clock this afternoon there'll be there'll be two telecast one on channel eight and one on channel five
A,So it's it's almost three o'clock now
A,Maybe we can get hold of if we can get hold of a TV we can listen in and see what's what has what actually happen this morning
B,Right right
A,Priscilla do you play any sports
B,Ah ya I I play squash and right now I'm trying to learn tennis with a friend of mine who is teaching me
A,Oh how how often do you play
B,Tennis
A,Tennis
B,Uh not very often
B,When he's free uh then he'll teach me you see so uh
A,Okay what about squash
A,Do you play squash very often
B,Oh now I don't
A,It's hard to get hold of a partner to play
B,Ya partner who's about the same level as you not too bad not too good you know that sort of thing
A,What about facilities
B,Uh I try to go over to IE uh rather College of Physical Education because it's just across the road from where I stay
A,Eusoff College
B,Eusoff college ya
A,Do you have to pay to get in there
B,Unfortunately yes but usually we can also you know just go there if there's nobody using
B,It's it's quite alright ya
A,Are are you very good at squash
B,Uh I'm not on the squash ladder or anything but uh
A,Just recreational play
B,Ya just recreational play
B,What about yourself Doctor Chui
A,I I don't play any
A,I I do I used to play tennis and and the squash as well but because it's difficult it's difficult to find a partner who is who who's on the same level as you
A,In in the case of tennis you find that if if you get a very good player you you find that you you picking up balls most of the time
A,So now I I I I in my spare time I run a lot jogging and so on
A,I'm still thinking considering whether I should participate in the end of year marathon
B,Oh the one up Mount Kinabalu is it
A,No no no no it
A,This is organised by Mobil the annual marathon Singapore marathon
B,Twenty-three K
A,Forty-six kilometres
B,Oh okay
A,So I'm still considering very hard whether I should put in the the registration form
B,But have you actually run such a distance before
A,I have done a half marathon uh a few years ago
A,That's about twenty-three or thirteen miles
B,Thirteen miles miles
A,Thirteen miles
A,That wasn't too bad
B,You mean you managed you did not walk
A,I did not walk yes
A,I I did run all the way didn't have to walk at all
B,Any ranking
A,No no just a like you uh uh like you I'm just a recreational runner so
B,Uh you don't play any other racket games at all
A,Not so much racket games no
B,Just running only
A,Just mainly running
B,Ah how about swimming
A,Swimming occasionally you know when when I when I uh when it's too hot then I just think I'll just go for a dip
B,Not not so much like a serious you know
A,No I don't swim laps so
B,Okay what what styles do you swim
A,Well breast-strokes or or free-style
A,Well I don't I I won't consider that really very serious swimming
A,It's just like taking a dip
B,Taking a dip right
B,Okay I'm I'm a pretty serious swimmer I would say
A,Oh really
B,I mean if I go into the pool I would like do laps you know
A,And how many laps do you do
B,Uh maybe twenty
A,Twenty laps
B,Ya
A,That's very good
A,Free-style twenty laps
B,No uh breast-stroke
B,But it's difficult to actually swim in pools because there are so many people there people keep banging into you
A,That's right that's right
B,Ya so it's not very easy to actually swim laps
A,I used to swim swim laps too but I find it uh uh like you say sometimes it's very crowded
B,Ya that's right it is very crowded
A,In the pool
B,But it's it's so nice to actually run and then swim you know
B,I don't whether you tried that before you you maybe you run about
B,I don't know how many K
B,I I run about two K then I'll go back change and go down for a for a swim
A,For a dip
B,Ya it's really refreshing
A,Have you considered the biathlon
B,No
B,As I said I ought
A,You can swim and run
B,But I think that swimming is usually done in the sea right
B,The triathlon
A,Ya but there there there are different ways of I think some some organisations have the swim in swimming pools
A,And they have done that before
B,Oh I see I object to swimming in the sea because uh I don't think it's very safe Many accidents have happened in Singapore and uh overseas as well
A,I suppose if you're a strong swimmer you don't have to worry about that
B,I'm a swimming pool swimmer not a not a sea swimmer
A,That's very that's very aiyah I understand what you meant
A,It's very different swimming in the pool and swimming in the sea because in the sea they've got currents and wave and all these stuff
A,So it it can really put you off
B,Ya true
B,Anyway it's just for fun lah
B,Swimming and running and all these it's just for fun not not not very serious about it actually ya
B,I I also actually teach aerobics presently
A,Oh do you
B,Ya ya ya
A,Where do you do that
B,In Eusoff College
B,I'm actually taking a class uh once a week
A,Once a week and what kind of aerobics do you do high impact low impact step
B,I'm trying to teach them high impact but uh the they are not that very fit right now but I think they will improve with time
A,I see
A,Are you certified
B,No
A,You're not
B,I'm not but I know I know how to do Jane Fonda's complete workout quite well with my eyes closed
B,Put it that way ya
A,I see
B,Because I have been watching the video and doing it for about more than a year
A,Oh
B,And I used to take classes in NUS as well as outside
A,Oh do you
B,Ya I used to so now I'm trying to teach them as a favour
B,Actually not because I I'm committed to it but as a favour because they want to learn
A,I see
A,I used to take a a few aerobic classes myself too
B,Oh I see
B,Where where about did you
A,Well I I I've join this uh club outside
B,So what type of aerobics
A,Oh well all sorts low-high high-low
B,Step
A,Step as well
A,Step is is pretty fun
B,Ya that's what I heard but I don't
A,Have you tried that
B,No I haven't tried it because they they only teach it outside
A,They don't they don't have it in NUS
B,In NUS no
B,I mean I stop going to the rhythmics club
A,I see
B,Ya but the NUS uh uh aerobics is actually uh ya quite is quite tough
B,You know the regiment
A,Is is this conducted by students or instructed from outside
B,Students
A,I see
B,Ya and uh but it's not bad you know
B,A lot of guys come as well and
A,Really
B,Ya and you can see them panting and puffing as well so that I know that I don't feel guilty when I do that then
A,Actually step is quite fun but when I still remember very first step class and uh it's not that easy initially because you you you really have to concentrate on what the instructress's doing
A,And it it it has to be you cannot think too much you just have to do it
A,You step up and down the the bench and you you cannot concentrate
A,I mean you cannot really uh if you if you try to think too much you you you get confused and you can't follow the class anymore
A,So it it depends very much on on your spontaneity so you just have to do it
B,But it's really fun
A,It it it it's really fun and uh it can be very high intensity too
A,You can really pant a lot
A,And it depends on how many steps you take
A,If you if you you can for beginners you start with just one bench one step then you promote you progress on to two steps
B,On the other hand Jane Fonda's workout it's it's really fun because uh it's it's a dance workout as well ya
B,So it's like that there's cha cha there rock n' roll and uh there's country uh so it's it's really interesting Scottish dance and all that
A,Really Scottish
A,But I've seen a programme I've seen a video tape once but probably it's a different one different tape
A,I I I if I've not mistaken she has a few tapes
B,She does
B,I think there's a there's one which is quite interesting
B,The lean routine
B,Uh it also involving like modern jazz ballet you see <X>
A,I see
B,Quite interesting actually
A,But I suppose that's more for girls
A,The guys will not
