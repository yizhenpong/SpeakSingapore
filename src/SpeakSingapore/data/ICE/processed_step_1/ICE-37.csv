B,Might sound like me
A,I think so
B,Okay
B,What do I sound like

B,You know arrest
A,Search warrant of a warrant of arrest
B,No
A,No no
A,What am I saying
B,Warrant of arrest is Hawaii Five-O
A,No you can go for a warrant of arrest if if a person defaults in appearance
B,Ya right
A,Uh warrant to search and seize
B,Warrant to search and seize that's right
B,That's what we're doing on Wednesday
A,Oh
B,Uh really
B,There are some counter features of our clients' fabric design
A,Kind of difficult right
A,On what basis
B,Copyright uh
A,Copyright infringement
B,Ya
B,I mean I've seen the two design uh the colours are very similar
B,But the designs I see uh not exactly alike <unclear> word </unclear> substantially alike
A,So <unclear> word </unclear>
B,I mean one look from far uh looks like the same material
B,But when you examine it closely and you're looking for differences you can find
A,If you're not
B,If you're not one cursory glance if you're really observant
A,Won't make a difference still
B,Then you you will be able to
B,You even if you are 'cause if even if you're very observant cursory glance you may not find it
A,Really
B,Ya but you have to look for the difference
A,Okay
B,Probably you can
A,But it but it happened to my client once you know
A,Where they called me up and started screaming saying that one of the departmental stores were actually selling uh the fabric uh
B,Uh uh
A,Uh that was similar to theirs and the reason why they were so uptight was because uh it was their summer collection
A,It was they were going to launch it and was already found in another departmental store
A,Uh so you know they actually went to buy up
B,Actually went to buy up every
A,They actually went to I mean they went to that departmental store and bought up the stocks
A,And then of course subsequently they spoke to the 'cause they were going to launch that design
A,So it would really spoil the market apparently
A,And but I compared the thing I couldn't tell the difference
A,I brought it home you know and my mother could tell the difference
A,She said texture-wise is different style print
B,Why didn't you go for your warrant of seizure and or search and and
A,No
A,The problem is that
A,Look uhm this one may not even beat the counterfeit because the fabric may come from the same source
A,So it's there is no copyright infringement
B,Right
A,It is the same garment
A,Same quality
B,It's a breach of contract
A,So it's a breach of contract which doesn't warrant a seizure you see
B,Uh uh no no hey am I <unclear> word </unclear> </I>
