B,Are you sort of like church friends
B,Ah you were so natural
A,Oh you only had one case study
B,Ya
A,Oh he had two
A,Oh all of you for A.E.s you all went around collecting data
B,No it A.E.s mine not collecting data
A,His was

B,I did my brother and and this friend talking about something they like their hobby CDs
B,So they're yakking and yakking and yakking
A,Over the phone nuh
B,No
B,They were yakking in the room so I just <unclear> word </unclear> left their recorder there
A,Really
B,It was so wonderful
A,Oh
B,All the scarly all came out
A,Ya I know
A,For for ours worse because we I taped the fam
A,You see if it's just me and my parents then it's it's okay you see
A,But then my godma came into the picture and then her friend came into the picture and then everybody started talking
A,So there was a mixture Teochew you know English <unclear> word </unclear> <unclear> word </unclear>
A,It's quite <unclear> word </unclear>
B,You see when my relatives get together you hear Cantonese Baba English
A,Ya
B,Then I speak to my Cantonese relatives in Baba
A,Ya boy that yesterday
A,I saw the the docu you know
B,Which one
A,Uhm Archie's mental or illness in
B,<unclear> word </unclear> what do you think
A,It's very bad
B,Why
A,I didn't even have time to think about the structure
A,I didn't even have time to think about the <unclear> word </unclear> or <unclear> word </unclear>
B,The the picture's very rushed very emotional right
A,No I I just that ethical problem put me off because she did
A,I I I don't know whether <unclear> word </unclear> told you
B,I heard she I heard she <unclear> word </unclear> the faces or blotched out the faces but then on
A,On other shots I saw them
B,Then what's the point
A,See she had this media case study okay
A,This uh mentally ill man okay
A,He he uh okay she when she introduced him that time you could see that she didn't really want to show his face you see
A,That's fine
A,And then she showed one part where she's introducing the mother you see
A,So you think there is nothing wrong you know because uhm she didn't really set out to hide their faces you see
A,So there's this shot of the mother walking you see walking to uh the the dining table okay to to get medicine for the son
A,And she walked towards the dining table
A,You can see obviously that that you know the lights all coming from the window you know
A,So if they they wanted to like cover her face <unclear> word </unclear>
A,Okay that's fine
B,Then
B,Then after that
A,You can't see her because she cut to her legs walking and then cut to her shot of her at the table already you see
A,The next thing you know they cut to this shot of her where the camera was taking by the side
A,So it's already quite dark you know the glow
A,Uh you know the glare and all that is no longer there you know and you could see the mother
A,You could see the mother and then she says Ah Seng uh you know come
B,What's the point like that
A,You see
A,No see so for for me I thought that this is nothing you know I thought that there was no attempt actually you know to to hide their face you know
A,Then when the interview came on it was in dark silhouette and the woman was speaking very emotionally
A,She cried you see
A,You know what I mean or not
A,She's speaking and then she was crying you see
A,Then you knew oh no she was supposed to hide the woman's face
A,But how come I saw
B,Maybe you should ask Archie
A,Must you know
A,I I'm going to tell
A,I'm I think it's ethical problem because I I
B,Unless the lady agreed to be filmed later on
A,I can put me off
B,Or either that or she
A,No but if she agreed
B,didn't she didn't tell her what she's filming
A,It's bluff lah come on you know
B,That's quite
B,It's very unfair to the family what
A,It's very unfair and then never mind you know
A,Okay then you see you know
A,There's this uhm then after that they cut away to the mother talking about her
A,The her her psycho son right
B,Uhm
A,So he he's at the void deck you know downstairs you know those stone seats
B,Ya ya
A,So he's puffing away you see
B,Ah then
A,So they cut to this wide shot he's alone talking to himself smoking wide shot but the angle the camera is high you see
B,Uh huh
A,And you can see the man's face
B,<O> laughs </O>
A,You see and then later they cut to his eyes then they cut to his his hands holding the cigarettes
B,And then you can see the face
A,Then slowly it's like photo fade
A,You're beginning to see the whole face you know
B,Then what's the point
A,I was so disgusted you know and then they cut from another part
A,Okay where he's talking to himself in hawker centre okay
A,She took a back shot so obviously she didn't want to show his face
B,But in in terms of dealing with issues was it
A,I was so upset with that I didn't even think much of the issues you know
A,So I was I was thinking it's so disgusting you know and the problem is is
B,Is the whole series over
A,No over already
B,How many
B,Three only uh
A,Three
A,The divorce one just finished
B,How was the divorce one
A,I don't know lah but you know very depressing lah
A,Entire three-week you know the way they did the trainers you know
A,Whoa very sad
B,That's the way it is what
A,But anyway the the mentally ill one in terms of issues
A,I felt that I didn't learn anything more
A,It's like the usual things that you would ask the old you know mentally ill people
B,How you cope the difficulty
A,No no no not how they cope you know but uhm how how
B,<unclear> word </unclear>
A,difficult it is for them to like <unclear> word </unclear>
B,That's all lah
A,You see
A,But then it wasn't well-rounded because they kept on saying you know from from the perspective
B,So it's just milking sympathy
A,Ya because they kept on saying that these poor chaps
B,Not not hard
B,Hard look lah at at the
A,You know uh uh employers don't want to give them a a a a job you know
A,Poor things and all that you see
B,So it's just like mental illness awareness kind of thing
B,Nothing deeper
A,They didn't get the
A,They didn't get employers' point of view on why certain mentally ill people
B,They're looking into it
A,May not be suitable
A,That is the one you know
B,They're doing
A,You must have an answer
A,Your docu can't be one-sided what
A,But in the end you all saying that ya these poor chaps you know
B,Ya
A,Trying so
A,Having ya having a hard time you know
A,Can't integrate into society
A,It's all their fault
A,So I I I don't know lah
A,I
B,Ah I went for the health screening just now
A,How
B,Cholesterol level safe
A,Really
A,Are they still having it on now
B,No more already
A,Aiyoh
B,But I paid five dollars
A,I wanted to you know
A,I called you at nine-thirty
B,I went down already
A,I know
A,I called you
A,Then see how much blood did they
B,One jar
A,A lot uh
B,No lah
B,One tube uh
A,One tube
A,That's a lot
B,Just to find out the sugar and the cholesterol lah
A,Aiyah I should have gone
B,And the the what it was so messy don't know whether the reading's correct
B,Whether it is really my reading or somebody else's
A,But the needles are all disposables right
B,I hope so
A,No they are
A,My brother says now they have all moved towards disposables already
B,I'm sure there are a number of HIV positive people there
A,Ya eeeee
A,No but if you
B,You should have tested for AIDs on the <unclear> word </unclear> uh
A,Uh no lah
A,What for
B,Then people won't know you see
A,No if they do that our dear Bachtiar will be most
A,Oh he's on leave don't worry
A,He'll be most aghast
B,Why
B,He doesn't want to know
A,No he says that it's it's an intrusion invasion of a person's privacy if you just test for HIV without asking for permission which is true lah you see
B,No but I think as long as you go to a government clinic and you know that they are going to test for HIV then you're
A,Then it's okay
B,You have no right already
A,Ya you've you you know that definitely <unclear> word </unclear>
B,You go there knowing what
B,Ya
A,But then again then they'll say Why in the first place must the government you know do that
A,That means whenever you test for blood they will test for HIV also
A,I mean like you go and say you go and say
A,Can you test my blood level
A,Can you test cholesterol
A,But you know how how this based on you you see
A,You give them permission test for blood test for I mean test for sugar test for cholesterol
A,But you don't say if you say don't test for HIV they can't
B,Then don't go to a government clinic uh
A,Huh
A,Aiyah I don't know lah
A,This HIV thing is so
A,Actually there are so many issues you know
A,Even if you talk about AIDs you know
B,Uhm uhm
A,You know the docu that you did
B,Uhm
A,Okay that's one part
B,That's only one part only
A,Ya docu cannot you know do everything
B,There's a lot more
A,Ya but but
B,Thought of looking into rights and all that
A,Ya like like this thing that you just brought up
A,You see I mean on the one hand Bachtiar does have a point to make you see
A,I mean no matter what you have a right to say that what my body should be tested for
B,Uhm
A,You know what I mean or not
A,If if you don't want to know whether you got cancer or not you know you you you just don't test for it
A,They can't test you without your permission you see you know
A,But then uh on the other hand there are other you know things lah
B,I think they should set up anonymous testing
A,Uhm that's what he suggested
B,Anonymous testing
A,Ya
B,In other words
A,But then you see
B,You you don't leave you don't even leave your name you know
B,You don't leave your name
B,You record uh
A,Oh then you go back and
B,You just go there they give you a number
B,Then you just quote that number
A,Okay okay then after that the government how they're going trace you
A,If you are HIV positive
B,They can't trace you they can't trace you
A,Then you you go and say Oh I got HIV positive
A,Go back and and feel very sad about it but you go on you know you don't undergo counselling
B,No they have counselling
B,They have counselling
A,No how can they undergo counselling when you don't give your name
B,No
A,You can just say Oh I I I <unclear> word </unclear>
B,You have to come back and get your results
A,Yes
B,When you come back before you go for your testing they'll counsel you because some people go there to test whether whether there's
B,It's alright
A,She's just
B,The more data the better
A,Oh ya
B,No but then later on after that they will counsel post- <unclear> word </unclear> pre-test counselling and post-test counselling
A,Yes but if you don't leave your name you can't force me to go for counselling right <X>
B,No they'll counsel you there and then
A,I just seem
B,in the clinic
A,Oh there and then
B,Ya After that it's up to you
