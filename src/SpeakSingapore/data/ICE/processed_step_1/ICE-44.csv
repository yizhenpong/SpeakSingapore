A,Then in the end he went for lunch uh
B,You went to lunch with him
A,Ya
B,Aiyo
A,Then he decided to go back home <unclear> word </unclear>
A,Just simple lighting lah
B,Ya
A,I told him the only elaborate ones where he requires to have some kind of shadow effect is your Agreement right
A,Then all the others we can just make do with whatever lights they have
B,Ya
A,So he said okay
B,Even if I mean worse come to worse just me a full
A,Ya lah just
B,Just a full
A,Illuminate the place
B,Ya
A,No lah I think it'll go to be very simple
A,JJ doesn't have uhm elaborate dimmer system when lights
B,No school has that
A,None of the schools have that
B,None
B,But AJ is is okay because some schools you can't get access to go the other side of the stage you know
A,Oh
B,JJ
B,It's impossible that's why I don't want to go down
A,Quite good know
B,Ha
A,Window town
B,Is it
A,Ya they have uh back passage
B,Ah Outram stage very good
A,<unclear> word </unclear> space and <unclear> word </unclear>
B,Outram's Outram stage has got like Kallang Theatre size
A,Ah
B,Deep very deep
A,Can go round
B,Ya it's very nice and the it's dark you see because the windows all covered
B,So you can do all sort of things
A,It's like auditorium
B,Lights are a bit primitive lah but at least you can
A,You still have
A,They have a dimmer system also
B,They don't
B,But they got CD player and all
B,I mean sound sound wise is good
B,But I think even if they don't have the dimmer system
B,At least can add lights and have a difference to it
B,Rather than the other school halls where the windows are all so bright and you can't <unclear> word </unclear>
A,The lights won't have any effects lah
B,Ya
A,Especially it's a school-hall
A,It's very bright even if you switch off the lights
A,In fact uh if if the place is very bright I rather not use lights
A,I mean coloured lights just use the the normal one
B,Ya
A,It looks better
B,Because I think for <unclear> word </unclear> these these colours will probably not work as well as say red or yellow
A,It be it appear too diffuse
B,<unclear> word </unclear>
A,You didn't read your article ah
B,I didn't I have not
B,People just told me about it
A,The article was quite good actually
B,Is it
A,Yeah
B,What did it say
A,Very well written
A,At at times it was
B,I didn't meet her know
A,Confusing <unclear> word </unclear>
A,You didn't ah
A,Then
B,She just got most of the info from Victorian and the and then she she spoke to me on the phone for about about five five ten minutes
A,Because it's interesting
A,The the lead article right uh when you started out the article they had this statement saying that uh you know Zaini <unclear> word </unclear> bah bah and then left a a regular paying job
B,Oh like that
A,Devote his time to dance
B,That that angle is it
A,Okay so it started out like that
A,But then after that it went all the way that you are the artistic <unclear> word </unclear> and all administrative <unclear> word </unclear> assistant coordinating the NUS Dance Ensemble and <unclear> word </unclear>
B,And they put that is it
A,Okay they put all that and then uh if <unclear> word </unclear>
A,He said he what he abandon his dream to become a teacher
B,Oh God really ah
A,Ya abandon his dream to become a teacher or whatever uh to devote his time uh you know
A,Because his love for art uh for dance over rule everything else that kind of thing okay
B,<unclear> word </unclear> So that went that
B,Then towards the end he said that uh if you if you ever uh know you talk about that
B,You you you did your degree right
B,Uh uh
A,And the he said you had so no one can grudge you on the fact you're not studying lah <unclear> word </unclear>
B,Oh oh
A,Neglect your education and all that
A,And the that if you were to decide to leave
B,And you've a degree
A,What you're doing now you can always fall back on your degree and on teaching with with say <unclear> word </unclear> lah
B,She said that ah
A,Ya
A,But then I was thinking that MOE may not find that very very flattering that you consider it like you know if everything else fails then you fall back on teaching
B,<unclear> word </unclear>
A,When I saw that I saw that that line I said
A,Is this <unclear> word </unclear> okay good lah not not too bad
A,That that one line uh
A,If I was MOE and interview
A,Oh I see
B,Go and tell to MOE lah
B,You got no choice okay
A,You want you take
B,Ya
A,<unclear> word </unclear>
B,There are other fish in the sea you know
B,But I haven't got my interview you know
A,Actually uhm but you want to teach right
A,That's the thing you see
A,They may consider they may even offer you a position in in in NTU or NIE to say take care of dance
A,That means you join the Ministry and dance like inspector for dance kind of thing
A,Then you go around the schools and things
B,I wouldn't mind
A,If you like uh maybe you should explore that area rather than go into teaching
A,Because I tell you uh you may enjoy teaching very much now but whether you really want to start teaching Geography
B,Have you tried
B,Have you have you prepared this speech to me before <unclear> word </unclear>
A,No no no
B,That's why you're so hesistant about telling me this
A,No I've I've told I've mentioned this to you before what
B,But you never told me about the alternative
A,Is it
B,About this inspector of dance
A,No that one <unclear> word </unclear>
A,I was just thinking about it for sometime
B,My cousin is the inspector of music
A,Yeah you see they have these positions right so in the past
A,What they did was they just uh kind of promoted teachers who were in charge of dance or music or whatever and then just upgraded them usually senior inspectors for music and are <unclear> word </unclear> extracurricular activity or whatever they call them
B,Ya <unclear> word </unclear>
A,Takes care of dance as well you see
B,Uh
A,Then usually they're neither dance dancers and so <unclear> word </unclear>
B,But they they usually started on teachers uh they were they
A,Ya they become teachers first
A,But then MOE also have a scheme where they bring in professionals that come in you know directly and then teach dance like in in uh NTU they
B,And damn tiring to teach dance you know
B,I find I don't know lah
B,I find need
A,It could be very tiring
B,I find it very
B,One thing about me uh
B,I have to do sideline
B,I cannot I I'm not a one track kind of person
A,<unclear> word </unclear> No that's why what I meant was that uhm if you you want dance to in a sense uh complement what
B,What I do
A,What you do right rather than it being the main thing <unclear> word </unclear>
A,But then you find that uh I don't know lah
A,I I've seen a lot of people who've gone into teaching and then find that they can spare time later to do dance or whatever
A,You find that it drains you so much that you will not benefit <unclear> word </unclear>
B,Ya it's true
B,But I mean idealistically speaking I just want to get money and and studying dance somewhere
B,That's idealistically and and like not even wanting to come back and work and hold some kind of responsible position I I
A,Great
B,Good lah
B,But wish but that's not my primary concern right now I mean like
A,You never you would never consider going say joining say SDT or it's very <unclear> word </unclear> lifestyle
B,If I come out <X>
A,But I heard that they were expanding themselves
B,Ya but if I come in I I don't like to come in because I'm I'm not a technical dancer but I'm a dancer- ideas <unclear> word </unclear>
B,So I you know so I rather work on my own <unclear> word </unclear>
A,With experiments
B,Ya and create something
B,So I don't know whether whether I'll call myself a choreographer first or a dancer first
B,But the thing I wanna call myself I don't know I <unclear> word </unclear> I don't know what you call it lah
