speaker,speech
1,Okay right quickly please can't wait for all eternity
1,Sit okay *whistle*
1,Sit sit
1,Brenda
1,She's sick
1,Yan Peng
1,Sick bay
1,Yvonne
1,There you are
1,Sorry sorry <unclear> word </unclear>
1,Where's the rest of eighty two
1,Did the rest of you bring the textbook
1,Okay right get <unclear> word </unclear>
1,Sit
1,Let's start
1,Okay before we begin that's Brenda Lee
1,She's here from the university and she's just taping us
1,Please don't go multiple sicion and shut up
1,Okay
1,We do need to get on with this
1,Alright fine
#,What
1,Ah yes well never mind
1,It's it's a bit of unavoided since that's already there okay
1,Right we're going to go through Much Ado and last week we started talking about <unclear> word </unclear>
1,Yes
1,Yes we did <unclear> word </unclear>
1,We did talk about
1,Did we go through it in detail
1,No
1,Alright
1,Let's start with that because you need to be absolutely sure how this text works
1,Now please be highly conscious that this is identical to Lear in terms of perceptions
1,You are going to always one of the principles that there is no one view about love that's presented by Shakespeare
1,But you're rather going to have ah multiple views presented by the multiple sets of characters
1,Now we've identified this now
1,Who are the sets of characters who are directly in the issue of love
1,Okay Beatrice and Benedict
1,Okay Claudio and Hero and Margaret
1,The announcer <unclear> word </unclear> hero
1,Ya
1,Okay why are you late
1,Alright quick
1,Okay recap right
1,We're talking about the aspect of love
1,I don't like people sitting behind me
1,I can't see them
1,Okay right
1,Okay let's get on to this okay
1,Now the question of time <unclear> word </unclear>
1,Is this that you need figure out
1,What are the kinds of views about love represented in the sets
1,The starting point has always got to be the kind of character love
1,Let's try and pick one particular group
1,Okay can we start with Hero and Claudio
1,And remember what we said
1,It's always easy if you have the same like love is something or love is shown to be something like in Lear
1,Okay we saw that love can be ungrateful
1,Okay or we came to understand that people's love cannot be quantified because of the behaviour of Lear okay where he attempts to drive Cordelia
1,To quantify it you find that it doesn't work
1,Love does not always have to be forgiving
1,It can be merciless as well
1,Right now do you see <unclear> word </unclear> of love in Much Ado
1,What are the angles
1,Let's start with Hero and Claudio
1,Okay that love can be superficial
1,Alright <unclear> word </unclear>
1,Can somebody pick it up please
1,What do we mean by love can be superficial
1,Mean what
1,Uh huh Okay
1,Right
1,Okay so that love can be at the top level <unclear> word </unclear> where there is the use of sight okay
1,You see and you respond you may not go beyond that Yes that love can be based on ignorance as well
1,Right
1,That's an idea that comes across that there is potential where love can be based on ignorance
1,Ignorant
1,Okay so that will be the example to prove that
1,What else is it
1,What else
1,Do we get caught
1,This this object topic of love by Shakespeare's presentation
1,You say love is naive okay
1,Are you using Hero and Claudio specifically
1,Can you give specific examples
1,Yes specific example we're sorting in the text that specifically show themselves to be naive about the concept of love <unclear> word </unclear>
1,And so
1,And what now
1,About the love for them
1,Right
1,Can we all agree with that
1,Anybody have difficulties with that
1,Leonard what time is it
1,Where were you
1,Didn't you get the message
1,Alright come on in
1,Okay
1,Right
1,So you have decided there is naive <unclear> word </unclear> love <unclear> word </unclear> because of the fact we don't like Judge <unclear> word </unclear> and unlike of what's going on rather you look around and you use information from secondary sources
1,Is love fickle
1,Is that the same as love being naive
1,Prove that love is okay but do you think that <unclear> word </unclear> that in the relationship between Hero and Claudio you see that love is fickle
1,Uh huh but what does he change
1,Opinion
1,So
1,What does love become
1,Right
1,That's a better way of putting it
1,In this case one sees the double relationship between love and trust
1,Okay how is this relation what should be the ideal state
1,Okay
1,Okay
1,Alright let's just <unclear> word </unclear> we've got two lines about this
1,One is that hero does sorry Hero does the dying bit and Claudio registers no emotion so the argument here here is love is fickle or frivolous because it is swayed
1,Are you using a different point Audrey
1,Okay now Audrey's point is that he only goes to Hero when he wants something and when he doesn't want it or it seems that he's not getting the whole quality of what he should be getting he drops it
1,He picks it up again with
1,It's quite clear she's innocent so there's a frivolity to his attitude towards love
1,It's not treated as a stable thing
1,It's more an imbalance thing where he moves from pole to pole
1,Is that the same being fickle
1,Alright what is that
1,Can we try a better word for fickle or frivolous for this thing that where you say I will love you if you love me back equal proportionately
1,Selfish
1,Conditional
1,What else
1,Love meets your expectations
1,Yes a very
1,What
1,Merit
1,Love has no merit
1,Okay where you set a value and if that value is not responded to what do
1,We don't want to <unclear> word </unclear> so it's condition
1,Okay
1,But ya I'm willing to accept the argument <unclear> word </unclear> that maybe the love here is fickle fickle
1,I'm going to accept that argument and the counter-ar argument going on as well that you know maybe it is because he's so hurt he does these things to Hero so therefore his love is true
1,Okay
1,Point he's <unclear> word </unclear> being miserable when she is dead
1,Okay now you're all not going to resolve this one
1,So some of you have resolved versus <unclear> word </unclear> two polar views about how you're going to look at Claudio
1,One of you obviously is not a Claudio fan quite clear okay but <unclear> word </unclear> so he's okay
1,Please let's not go into those kind of analysis but yes there are multiple responses
1,It's exactly like the Lear
1,Get used to it
1,The comedy you may think you hate it but <unclear> word </unclear>
1,Alright let's go on
1,What other aspects of love can you see
1,With Hero and Claudio at work
1,Try and think about the way they enter this love relationship
1,Conventional ya
1,It's a display of conventionality that surrounds love and marriage okay
1,Okay can we please explain the conventionality go on to the <unclear> word </unclear> idea
1,Ya one Claudio woos her by proxy
1,What is already wrong if you woo by proxy
1,Yes you aren't understanding somebody else
1,What does that mean about your own understanding if you send somebody else
1,You don't actually understand the person or uh you can't use the word insulting
1,Why would it not be correct to use the fact that it'll be insulting to the other person if you woo by proxy
1,Right this is the convention at that time that argument is <unclear> word </unclear>
1,It's the convention of the period that you could do this but given that what does it do to your love relation
1,Ya
1,You yourself lack knowledge alright
1,And please remember the issue of knowledge and love <unclear> word </unclear>
1,Knowledge what
1,You tell me
1,Who
1,Who said what
1,Leonard where where are you
1,Leonard if you hide behind the chair
1,Okay what knowledge of what
1,Each other
1,Ya okay
1,So you've got that element to consider as well
1,Right
1,Elaine had the idea that love here is seen to be rash
1,Why rash
1,Right there is the <unclear> word </unclear> of her naive
1,Isn't the way naive is
1,Okay fine you got to <unclear> word </unclear> to that
1,Who wants this
1,Everybody you got the argument it's rash and you also have the argument that it is a sign of real love because didn't <unclear> word </unclear> say love him marry him
u,
i,love is rash

o,because they use a tool they are she's got she's got the half of the problem there that that they are the two who talk <X>
s,where Hero wants nothing but to say 'I shall <unclear> word </unclear> ' and Claudio does nothing but listen very well to everybody else and not talk to Hero Right so there's always the use of the proxy Now your idea of proxy comes <unclear> word </unclear> By using proxy to communicate in the affairs of love there it becomes insulting for an audience to believe Okay So you've got to try and draw the line where is conventionality acceptable where isn't it And how can the lack of communication mar a relationship especially in the issue of love Okay go on Okay so what are you then saying Okay right well it's as you can see right on this small subject we're already having multiple views about these characters We're going to try and reconcile these yes we're going and get a part of the problem here Are we then saying that they are so similar that they fail to see each other because they can't Or are we saying that they are so similar they must see each other What then is your stand for the two of them They're too proud right The issue of pride <unclear> word </unclear> Alongside communication somebody brought up the idea of scornful love okay This is where you're going to talk about pride impeding in love Alright even though they have knowledge of each other what do they fail to have knowledge of Other <unclear> word </unclear> they have knowledge of each other what do they fail in Themselves Right that's where you get it Pride impedes </X> </I>
