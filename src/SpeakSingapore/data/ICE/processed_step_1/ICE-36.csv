B,I found out that they don't even have a HRD
A,Uh I see

B,So I I I I want to put it nicely when they offered me the job at a certain price I quoted
B,I I asked for something much higher
A,Uhm
B,Like much higher means uh it's about six more than five thousand dollars higher
A,I see
B,Ya
B,So I was thinking maybe they'll turn me down immediately you see but they say they'll think about it
B,Then yesterday they call me and tell me they will give me
B,So I said oh oh
B,But the problem was we did we you see they talk so much you know so much so that when I wanted to ask them certain things uh I didn't have a chance and then I forgot
A,Uhm
B,Ya so you know things like how many months' notice I must give how many days' annual leave are you giving me and things like that

B,I have to give three months' notice
B,I have to I've only get I I'll only be getting fourteen days' annual leave
A,Oh
B,Which is the same as here
B,That's what I was telling him about you see
A,Uhm
B,I'm hoping that I'll get something more unless it's a five-day week then fourteen days is okay you see
A,Ya
B,Then he said oh
B,He qualified lah
B,He said they will be looking into that uh in the following in the next one year because they are thinking of coming up with some company policy
B,But the that's not a promise you see
A,Uhm
