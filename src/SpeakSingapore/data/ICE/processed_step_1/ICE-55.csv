A,Ya we wanted to submit early right
A,You know our our the the department told oh you can't
A,You we don't know where to put it
A,Please come back on the twenty-ninth
B,Ya
A,The the tray the box or something is not here yet you know
A,Can you imagine
B,Is it Rita Skuya
A,Uh it wasn't
A,No because when you submit you submit through the administration you know
B,Ha ha
A,If you remember your sub you submitted
B,But you see they are they are given like different secretaries you see to to handle
A,Ya ya ya
B,I noticed that
A,I don't know which which uh secretary
A,I can't remember her lah
B,I noticed she had a space crisis
A,But no that's so silly isn't it
B,Don't you have to serve the bond right
A,Ha I escaped it
A,I didn't sign it
A,I left before I signed it just before I signed it
B,So how long were you in IE
A,About three months I think
A,It's about three or four months right before you
B,Enough to to fiddle to know what's it feel
A,To know ya
A,Oh that's crazy
A,I mean you know there was this lesson that we go through that they teach you
B,How to make transparency
A,Ah and oh how to use the blackboard
A,That's the worst
B,How to use the chalk
A,how to use the blackboard that was like
B,I skip the lesson
A,Uh please divide into four
A,Then can you write in this fashion <unclear> word </unclear> or not
B,Ya ya ya
A,But how could you skip
B,I skip I skip lessons
A,Oh you skip lessons ah
B,Because you see we have the benefit of like past uhm student past year student telling us about what to skip you see so
A,Ya and we were the guinea-pigs
A,What what we've to go through the whole everything
B,What batch were you
B,Eight-seven
A,1987
B,That's the year you graduated
A,Ya
B,That's the last year right
B,Without bond
A,Uh no no no there is a bond but you know it's sign mid mid way through the course
A,It's not right at the beginning
B,No but at our time they make us sign right from beginning
A,Oh they got smart
A,No lah but 1987 was a very bad year if you remember so there were a lot of people applying to to to
B,What about Newpaper
B,How's it
A,Newpaper ah Newpaper was fun
A,If if I had to go back to full-time work again I think if I had my way that would be the best
B,So you left primarily because of your
A,Because I got married
A,You know how you you are you're going to be ready right for the horrible hours
B,But excuse me this is the this is the you know we we're even to have a book publish on women
B,Women In Singapore
B,Uh most women
A,About the other women
B,Ya most women are ya most women are like you know either they're single
A,No lah
B,Or they're you know they're
A,Let me tell you lah
A,In Straits Times most women are either single divorced married again
B,Or they're not straight
A,Or they're not straight
B,That's quite true so far
A,I'm telling about us from reporters you know
B,Ya
A,The the the sub-editors are not like that because they lead pretty regular grave-yard hours you see
A,Because they're always on grave-yard so they can at least have some order to their lives
A,You must be prepared because there was one stretch where I was working nine to twelve midnight
A,Nine am twelve midnight
A,Nine am twelve for four days in a row
A,That's when I after I've done it was exhilarating and all that
A,You see if you're on a high you can't sleep at night you know
A,Imagine going back at twelve and you've just finished this glo glorious story you know
A,You can't sleep so you know it's very very unhealthy
A,I decided I mean it's not fair
A,What if I'm going to get married
A,To put someone through all that
B,Ya that's true lah
A,There was this woman who perpetually had her husband waiting outside
A,But you see not all husbands can do that know and is it fair or not to ask all husbands do that for you
B,Even if yours did
B,It it will come a point where
A,It's too much
B,You know he says it's too much ya
A,Can you imagine she he would sit you know She would be typing her story he'll sit right before
A,Are we finished
A,No
A,She he can sit there for four hours you know
B,I think to a certain extent teachers too during term time lah
B,But at least we have a lull you know like during the break
A,Ya
B,Uh they go on holiday you know
A,No there is no such thing as a lull
A,If you're a good reporter there's never a lull
B,Ya
A,So maybe you know you can say that you pace yourself but if you're a good reporter you can never let a story go you know
B,That's true that's true
A,So how how how could you
B,Ya
A,You still dancing or not
B,Uhm a bit lah
B,Not not not so much ya
B,This is suppose
A,You pig
B,To mine Chris
A,Yes
B,So long were you there
A,Newpaper
A,I was there about two and a half years
B,Three years
A,two years
B,That's quite long
A,Long enough lah you know <unclear> word </unclear>
A,The but it's a very it's very enjoyable as a single
A,It's okay
A,But if you are thinking of marrying I don't think it's very a healthy life
B,That's true
A,Even as a single
B,It's a very all consuming thing right isn't it
A,Ya it is it is
A,And you get jaded very fast
A,You get very cynical
A,There was it came to stage where you know
B,About what
B,People
A,Life
B,Life
A,In general ya
A,You mean you you get this jaded that when people call in and say oh there's an accident along Paterson Road
A,Then you know someone will ask very casually
A,Anybody died or not
A,Nobody died
A,Ah forget it
A,So many vehicles
B,I suppose it's just like doctors right after a while you know
A,Ya ya ya
A,It's like you dis you know you could dissect someone eating char kway teow or something
B,Like a friend of mine Sheng Kwai was telling me that he has got this friend not friend lah you know BB boy
B,He became a houseman and you know being Christians and know that they're supposed to be
A,Compassionate
B,Compassionate
B,But after a while it's like you know treat it like another person another patient you know
B,I mean
A,It's another body
B,<unclear> word </unclear>
A,To cure
B,Ya
B,I mean when you're especially when you're covering say the midnight hours
B,Can you be imagine how much <unclear> word </unclear>
B,Do you have when you're like half asleep
A,And some patients are very difficult
A,Same thing lah
B,That's true
A,So I got to I realize lah that I that's not what I want
A,To become you see
A,You look around you know and you of course there are people who survive
A,If you're talking about Christians there are quite a number of very you know strong Christians
B,In journalism
A,Yes there are but very few of them
B,I suppose Chong Jin will be one of them
A,Chong Jin
A,Are you kidding
A,Chong Jin is the wayward one
B,But he was I mean he was
A,He was like ra ra all fire you know
A,No he's not anymore
A,That that scared me
A,I also saw him you know going that way
A,It you know we used to look up to him like some sort of mo role model
A,Because he was one of those who was very uhm he was zealous but not to the extent where he he you know like I I don't know how you describe him
B,No he strike one as a
A,very balanced
B,Who's really
B,Who lead a very strong moral fibre
A,It's no longer so
A,No but you know you see him fall and he himself has no regrets you know
A,I think from the way he speaks the way he talks about it
A,It's like it's this one aspect of life
A,And he his uh his religion has become a philosophical thing
A,So it was very scary
A,We were you know we we did talk quite a bit when we were in there
A,So it scares you radiant
B,I'm not sure
B,I mean I'm just buying a do you know
B,I just accept this as buying a ticket out of what I'm doing now <X>
A,Which school are you teaching at
B,Ahmad Ibrahim
A,Ha
B,Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary School
A,That's like way in Jurong
B,Uh that's what everybody thinks
A,It's not ah
B,It's eventually uh in uh Yishun
A,Yishun
B,It used to be in Upper Thomson Road but they moved
A,Oh
B,Ya it's just one of those things lah named after the It's suppose to be the first Malay minister
A,But it's a very difficult school isn't it It's not not notorious
B,Not really it's supposed to be a the better school in the North North
A,Really Why do I always have this impression that it's one of those difficult schools
B,Because of the name Maybe Ahmad Ibrahim you know like Sunila Utama
A,I don't know how the students ever live that down Sunila Utama I come from Sunila I hope they think of a change you know
B,Ya I mean there're so many schools named after roads you know what I mean
A,So silly There's going to be an Ang Mo Kio Avenue two school something very soon
B,Ya But your school's not good enouh to be named after somebody like somebody substantial But I suppose I think you've always been the kind of person who wants everything in life
A,Ya I suppose
B,I don't think you'll settle just for a career
A,Ya I don't think so It's it gets to you know after awhile you you realise that a lot of the so-called strong women there you you observe them you know they ya their career is everything it's all consuhming that I think to ex <unclear> word </unclear> They think they're so emanci emancipated and you know they are not uhm they they're their own person and all actually they're not There're actually slave to their work
B,They're strong because they have no other choice you see What are the alternative I mean if they if they don't act strong they have to admit that oh oh
A,They have chosen the wrong path or ya ya
B,I mean I have known so many S B C producers I mean like uhm I mean even Millie who are okay I mean not not sort of like it doesn't sound like our sub-cultural groups lah like you know but normal women who are very feminist but deep down they still have this problem
A,urge
B,with their emotional dependence
A,I ya I've never been a feminist
B,I think depends on what you mean by feminist I mean you can be a feminist without losing your essential femaleness you know So at the end of the day you're made to need somebody
A,Ya
B,So if you deny that then you deny that part of yourself
A,You know because a lot of the editors uh are all of course they are all children of the sixties lah No not children of the sixties I think they went throuh the sixties in their teenage years you know So for them you know feminism is such a burning thing But I think in their late later years now like they're in their thirty-nine and forty they start to realise that maybe they've gone wrong But it's too late to admit it isn't it without losing every you know
B,It takes a lot of to admit maybe without without making sound like you've made a mistake I think that's a sad thing I mean look at Pat Chan I you still think she's a victim of her own achievements you know I think she has achieved so much you can't even live it down It's like how can I ever like you know going for a man You know what is it that he has that I don't You know
A,Special organs Why do you think <unclear> word </unclear> she's gonna fix the organs as well
B,Because I think she's not really I don't know I mean I know her as a person
A,But she's a very charming person you know
B,She likes to dress up you know she likes to you know everytime there's anything new at Issey Miyake she will go and buy but she'll only scarves and shirts I find you know what I mean she's not really I don't think she's I mean more new <unclear> word </unclear> you know
