A,Share with me your knowledge of insurance Raymond
A,What do you know
B,Uh uh
A,And what you may not know or understand
A,What do you have at the moment too
B,At the moment I have a small N T U C Income policy uhm uh but I don't really know much about insurance
B,Uh because that time I got it uh just because the N T U C Income agent came down to our uh army camp
A,Oh I see
A,Okay
A,You may be wondering why I ask you so many questions
A,The reason is to know what actually you want and what actually you need
A,Oh yes just to confirm what you have shared
A,You are 27 years old right
B,Yes
A,You are married and you have a six month old baby boy
A,You have an insurance programme when you were 18 years old from N T U C when you were in the army
A,And a small protection of fifteen thousand dollars whole life plan
B,yes yes
A,So what made you to consider to have more insurances now
B,Well uhm ah basically I am earning much more now and uh besides I see a lot of people around me suffering from critical illnesses that really cost a bomb to the family
B,And uh in the end it will leave the family in the lurch when they die
B,So uhm at this moment I wish to save more as well as to provide more protection for my family sake
A,Ok so you feel that you are older now earning a higher income you and you have a family now and also you wish to have the savings as well as protection for your family right
B,Yah
A,Okay now besides that what other things do you have in mind
A,You must have beard from other companies or from your friends the company's products
B,No ah not much so far
B,As a matter of fact I didn't bother about it initially
B,So I don't really have a grasp of what insurance can offer me
A,Oh I see
A,Okay
A,Now in this case since you shared with me that you do not really have a grasp of what's available or for the matter what kind of insurance there are I will start with you some basic understanding of insurance
A,Insurance is basically savings put in a certain institution called insurance company that will give you a higher amount of money back when the policy matures or where the company will take uh undertake for you certain responsibilities when you die permanently and totally disabled or when you are diagnosed of a certain critical illness
A,There are basically 3 kinds of insurannce namely
A,1 Term plan
A,2 Endowment and
A,3 Whole life plans
A,Term plans generally gives you a high coverage for death or permanent disability with no returns that is there will not be any money in return if nothing happens to you
A,It's like renting a flat where you don't own it
A,Once you leave yu have to return it to the owner
A,Endowment plans gives you a certain amount of money at a certain period say after 20 years
A,You will need to put aside a generally higher premium for this plan
A,It also covers you for only death and permanent disability only
A,You can add riders like hospitalisation benefits or critical illnesses coverage etc to this basic plan
A,Whole life is somewhat different
A,It covers you for life at a much lower premium due to death permanent disability as well as upon diagnosis of critical illness
A,Okay am I going too fast for you Raymond
B,Ah no so far so good
A,Okay
A,Good
A,I'm glad that you understand so far
A,And ah just to reinstate
A,I understand that you wish to protect yourself against illnesses death and to do a little savings for your old age as well as for your little prince's education
A,Right may I ask what is your budget for yourself and for your son
B,Ah well
B,I think for myself it will be around the range of $250 and ah my uh
B,I mean
A,For your son
B,For myself 250 and for my son probably a hundred
A,Okay
A,Now uhm as a professional in this field I always feel it is important to look into the welfare for our family those who are still around when we are gone
A,I am happy to know Raymond that you thought likewise
A,Let me print this out for you
A,Okay I'm proposing to you this plan that pays you a hundred thousand if premature death were to occur to you right now or when you are unfortunate to be diagnosed of any of the 30 illnesses
A,In this case you will also receive a paid lump sum of 20 per cent to the sum assured on the first year and subsequently the remaining 80 per cent on the second year when you are totally and permanently disabled
A,After that you will be paid a yearly amount of fifty thousand till you are age 65
A,Wow does this sounds good
A,The beauty of this plan is that you need to only pay for 20 years after which the plan will automatically grow on its own earning bonuses as it goes along
A,Moreover with these two plans with this plan your two kids including your future child will be given free critical illnesses coverage of ten thousand each if they are diagnosed of the illnesses
A,They must be between the age of thirty days old to eighteen years old
A,Ain't that good
A,What do you think of this plan
B,It seems so interesting ah I mean what John Hancock can offer
B,You mean that any of my child is diagnosed for any of the 30 illnesses I'm able to claim ten thousand from John Hancock
A,Yeah yeah
B,So what happen to my policy then
A,Your policy still carries on till you either cancel it or till there is a claim made
B,So you mean I can like take out some money after 20 years
A,Yeah you can you can cash it out but I have a better idea
A,You don't cash it out but instead you take a loan carry on with the Giro deduction and you are still under cover by John Hancock
A,You need not pay back till you have the money
A,If anything does happen to you or you wish to surrender it later the amount at that point of time would always be higher than what you borrowed
A,There are lots of ideas that I can share with you that can benefit you and your family while you save with John Hancock
B,That sure is interesting
B,And what about my son's plan then
A,Now uhm he'll be going to the army when he's 20 about 18 years old and he'll be in the university when he's 21 years old so it's about 20 years from now
A,Now I've worked out this plan whereby you can take out a sum about forty thousand
A,When he's 21 years old and moreover for this kind of plan children's plan if anything does happen to you or your wife be it in terms of death permanent disability or diagnosis of illnesses the premium will be totally waived meaning you don't have to pay anymore
A,John Hancock will take the responsibility of paying the premium
A,You just pay for the time to come
A,When he's 21 years old and you can take out the money
B,Oh there is something now whereby even if my wife is diagnosed of illness or what you call death of disability I don't need to pay anymore
A,Oh yah yah
B,So uhm in fact what you share with me so far I think
B,<O> car honking </O>
B,Uhm well basically will meet my needs and my family
B,Well ah looks like John Hancock do provide some good products
B,I think ah I like to sign up ah for such a plan
B,<O> rustling of papers </O>
A,Well I'm glad that uhm you wish to do that but just to reinstate do you understand so far what I've shared what I shown to you and illustrated to you
B,Well ah so far uhm yes
A,Ok Raymond so can I have your IC so that we can start the process of filling in the forms and uhm make the payment too
B,Uhm Okay no problem here is my IC
A,Uhm all right thank you
A,Well Raymond I'm very happy for you
A,Do you know that you've actually put your family first by getting these plans
A,Just to recap what you've signed up
A,You've got for yourself a plan that protects you a minimum of a hundred thousand if you faced premature death or upon diagnosis of any of the 30 critical illnesses and if you are totally and permanently disabled to receive 20 per cent of the sum assured that is twenty thousand for the first year and subsequently the remaining eighty thousand on the second year
A,You will also be receiving an additional twenty thousand till the age of sixty five
A,Moreover any two children will be covered for ten thousand upon diagnosis of any of the critical illnesses
A,As for your son you will receive at least forty thousand after 20 years even if you or your wife is not around or when you are diagnosed of any critical illnesses or if you are totally or permanently disabled
