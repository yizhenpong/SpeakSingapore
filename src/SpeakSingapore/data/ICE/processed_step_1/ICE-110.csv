A,Okay let's get started
A,Uhm I'm going to give you a handout
A,It's uh there's uh those are the things you're going to do today
A,I don't know how you're feeling today
A,Not too good for me I've got a sore finger uh
A,Okay let's get started
A,We're going to talk about uh working with parents today and uh this going to be very important because when you go to the primary schools you'll be working a lot with parents a lot more than when you are in secondary school alright
A,So we're going to look at different aspects of uh parent-teacher relationship and why is it important to establish good relationship with parents okay
A,Do you think you could get settled down and yah
A,Okay so uh to start off we want to talk about the different types of uh school-home relationships
A,Uhm I re I think most of us are from different types of schools uhm perhaps government schools and others the uh the government-aided school
A,So there are actually different types of relationships that these schools have with the family or with parents uh only like to suggest that the very first type of school is what 'keep out' you know
A,This this school will probably say hey you know we we run the business we know all about education so you just do your parenting at home and leave us alone alright keep out
A,So I I think you might have seen signs around in schools that say 'Parents must not enter the school premises unless the the alright
A,And there are some other schools called usual school and these are the school that say 'Okay if you wanna come in you are welcome but if you want if you don't want to come to school that's alright too
A,I mean we've called upon you and you don't want to come that's fine
A,If you want to come that's fine too usual type
A,And then of course there are the P-T-A school parent-teacher association
A,Uhm I think a number of schools in Singapore have taken this kind of approach now but mainly I think the pity is that most of them <unclear> word </unclear> to fund raising
A,You know they are referring to curtains ah wanna donate money to build the swimming pool and things like that
A,That's about it alright
A,And of course there are the true community schools where uh surely you read the report about the new Raffles Girls' school where they're going to have uh open up the school premises for computer classes <unclear> word </unclear> in the evening alright where they're going to welcome parents in to uhm conduct courses for the students in there okay that's a community school
A,So when you go to school the next time you're going to see for yourself what what what kind of school do you think your school falls under
A,What category does it fall under okay
A,So that's that's just to start you off with types of home-school relationship
A,Uhm let's see why is it important to establish good parent-teacher relationship interaction
A,You know when the parents come to school uhm they they actually see how the school operates especially the primary school they like to but they keep them out isn't it
A,In primary one they are not allowed to go in but they they still peep through the windows and see what's happening
A,So they can see the learning environment and they can know what's the school programs are
A,They they they can look at the notice board and see uh what sort of <unclear> word </unclear> programs there are what sort of E-C-A activities there are alright
A,What sort of medium programs and all okay
A,So they can actually see uh how teachers teach sometimes or maybe in talking to the teachers they can know what sort of teachers there are in school uh what sort of approaches they use and things like that
A,And very importantly the third point sometimes you may have set some kind of work for students especially weaker ones and you would like them to be supervised by their stu uh by their parents at home
A,So that's when you need parents to supervise and make sure that their children have done the appropriate homework the the assigned homework alright
A,And sometimes the parents will ask you in school uh when they talk with the teachers in in the process of talking with the teachers they can learn something about how important the parental role is just a guidance and supervision
A,Not only in academic areas but in the others in social emotional development <unclear> word </unclear> right
A,And of course parents can make some significant significant contributions to the school
A,Ah not sure whether you re have read articles about uh schools like St Nicholas
A,Have you read anything about the art where they actually ask parents to come in to talk on certain programs
A,Is anybody familiar with that kind of uh interaction that St Nicholas school has
A,Do you know what what they do
B,<unclear> word </unclear>
A,Yah they did
B,<unclear> word </unclear>
A,<unclear> word </unclear>
B,Singapore teach uh to teach courses
A,To teach courses I see
A,Now what sort of courses can you
B,Story-telling
A,Ah okay story-telling
A,Oh parents are involved with reading program
A,They actually break the children into small groups and parents come in to read to the kids or they help out in help help out in library work and things like that okay
A,And I think they do something about gardening too right
A,So that's an avenue you can tap parents' expertise
A,Okay so we say that parents need teachers because parents can see all these things happening but teachers also need parents because they can use parents to be a member of the teaching team
A,It means uh whatever aspect in school the parents can go back and supervise their children alright
A,I'm not sure whether you're familiar with this term called contracting
A,Sometimes when the kids come to see you and this kid uh not very well-disciplined so you wanna have a contract some kind of a time-table alright to say that hey watch less of TV and spend that two hours doing Maths something like that
A,You know when you see the parents and you may wanna give that contract with the time-table that kind of thing
A,Will you please supervise your child every night for two hours alright
A,So the parents can be a member of the teaching team and then they can provide supportive and extend <unclear> word </unclear> experiences meaning if they can actually <unclear> word </unclear> their children out in perhaps assessment work you know other <unclear> word </unclear> activities at home
A,What sort of uh educational toys they can buy for their children
A,Okay and then by doing that you you hope to see a snowball effect
A,Other parents see that hey uh these parents are actually <unclear> word </unclear> quite involvement with their children's work maybe we should do likewise or or maybe we should get other parents together and and and come together to school and uh and help out in the school management or other school committee alright
A,So I hope you can see uh the importance of P-T interaction from there but very often more often than not you hear about complaints about parents right
A,Later on we will talk about problem parents okay and how to handle them
A,Okay so after stating the importance of uh P-T interaction what are the ways we can ensure that this kind of interaction work out
A,I'm not sure whether you might have some ideas
A,I'm sure you can think of meet the parents right
A,Did your parents ever go to your school when you were in school
A,How many of you how many of your parents did
A,None of you <O> laughs </O>
A,I think they've this thing called Meet the Parents and they've lots of concerts where they invite parents right
A,Uh I don't know how many of your parents went to school
A,Okay this some of the ways to establish good relationship with the to make the school as a welcoming place
A,Uh well as <unclear> word </unclear> says inviting school lah you know facilitating this inviting environment
A,Are there things around parents can walk in and see that they know that they are welcomed alright
A,They'll talk about I know the oversea they talk about parents' room they even have special bulletin boards for parents you know when they can hold up some information for parents
A,I'm not sure whether this is done in Singapore I don't think any school has a parent room
A,I'm not sure if the new A-C-S has a parent room I doubt it
A,Anyway the idea is to welcome parents coming in
A,They could for school assembly
A,You may think that these are very western ideas but uh there'll be some there may be some of them which you can modify and and think about
A,In the west they talk about morning coffee then uhm you know I think this is done in Singapore where parents help out in outings organising outings and taking the children out
A,Very much so <unclear> word </unclear> because they they need adults around to supervise the children maybe one adult to five children <unclear> word </unclear> small ones you know
A,So I think parents uh can be asked to fork out there
A,Okay so these are some of the ways and some very specific ways would be uh written communication where there are class bulletins there there are newsletters especially for parents got to bring the facts there
A,Now I was in the hospital last time <O> laughs </O>
A,Yah okay so there are there are special newsletters for parents involve parents in <unclear> word </unclear> in school and future events and uh some achievements of students there and things like that lah okay
A,Uh as far I know <unclear> word </unclear> A-C-S has one Report Express
A,Not sure about other schools
A,Have you come across any
A,I think Heng Boys has one too primary school I because my nephew is from that school
A,I think they have one <unclear> word </unclear>
A,Do you know of any other primary schools that give letters to parents yeh Cedar 'A' yeh
C,<unclear> word </unclear>
A,Oh it's alright
A,There are one of those
A,It's a primary school or second primary school is it
A,Oh that's good ya
A,So the idea is that if there is a this channel of communication with parents letting the parents know about what's happened in school alright
A,And uh school report annual report <unclear> word </unclear>
A,Not sure every student gets it but in some schools they do
A,School magazines you know alright
A,And besides these uh avenues of written communication there are al also a lot of informal discussions that can be carried out but the idea is that the teachers must not feel threatened
A,You know sometimes when parents come in teachers can feel a bit threatened
A,What do you want
A,Why did what do they complain you know
A,And what what do you really want from me
A,Uh I I at the other side of the coin some parents also feel that whenever teachers call about it must be that little Tommy is misbehaving alright
A,Uh so you have to establish this kind of understanding that uh we don't call upon you just because there's some problem right
A,So that's why these uh morning coffees and uh uh uh at evening just to meet the parents not just to talk about results you know
A,Very often at meet-the-parents sessions you you hand in your report book uh and very often you give your report only when the parent come comes along isn't it
A,And we want to make sure that those who fail are the parents of those student who fail must turn up alright
A,No but I think the the kind of <unclear> word </unclear> uh <unclear> word </unclear> perpetuate the kind of thinking in parents okay
A,So sometimes you get uh whole conferences where parents <unclear> word </unclear> I'm saying that certain schools that arrange for talks and sessions like uh parenting style and how to be an assertive parent how to bring up your child gracefully whatever is <X>
