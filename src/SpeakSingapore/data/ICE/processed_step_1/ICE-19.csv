B,That's what I would do
A,and then
B,Uhm
A,I mean how do you know it's ready

A,Oh then you have to some kind of scummy kind of frost rises to the surface
B,Ya and you'll you'll have to scoop off the scum and throw it out
A,Throw it out
B,and you can put in other ingredients like
A,So as long as it's frothing just scoop off all the froth
B,Yeah
A,and then what happens
A,And then it just keeps boiling and boiling
B,Ya I I'm not sure
B,Maybe I've got to boil it for about two hours
A,And then
B,Uhm
A,and then after you've skinned it all off what you have is pure stock is it
B,I think so
B,Ya ack oh

B,you'll probably add some spices your salt and all that ya
A,Oh okay
A,Did you learn to cook before you were married

B,Now
A,ya when you get back and you're very tired
B,Uhm

B,then we got a food processor
A,Oh
B,so we're going to try new stuff
A,Oh no
B,So that's my my my new interest
B,Cooking baby's food
A,Oh ya I feel like getting a crockpot too
B,Ya I think <unclear> word </unclear>
A,Because I've heard it's ever so easy
B,Uhm
A,You can get a really nutritious meal
B,Ya
A,uhm and have it cooking while you're at the office
B,Ya
A,So
B,That's right
A,Unless you get an electrical fire in the meantime
B,That's not likely
A,So how uhm is this the first time you've started using a crockpot
B,Uhm it will be my first time
B,I haven't used it yet
A,Using the crockpot
B,Ya
A,Uhm
A,Feel like getting one but my kitchen is so small
B,Oh where're you living
A,We're living at Pandan Valley
B,Ya
A,We just moved in a few days before Christmas last year
B,Uhm uhm
A,Ya we like it very much but uhm uhm no actually there are no buts we actually do like it very much
A,I was just
B,Is that your own place
A,Ya we just bought it uhm last year
B,Ya uhm
A,Uhm oh now I know what I was trying to say
A,This thing threw me up and made me really nervous
A,I mean we like it very much but uhm sometimes we feel like we don't get to enjoy it enough because uhm okay we're working the whole day that's fine
B,Ya
A,you know everybody works the whole day
B,Ya
A,But then when we get back very often we have work to do still so we're sort of
B,Uhm
A,Hunched over the Macintosh you know trying to type things out
B,Ya
A,Or you know so
A,Sometimes like the last weekend this weekend that just came and went there was a chance for us to you know sit there and just enjoy being in our own home
B,Ya
A,you know
B,Like cooking
A,Ya like cooking and just looking out the yard looking out the window and the you know the lawn outside
B,Uhm
A,So we really enjoyed that a lot ya
B,Ya
A,But I guess it's not that bad lah to at least like your home a lot
B,Ya
A,Even if you feel like you know
B,Uhm
A,You wish you had more chance to just sit there and enjoy it rather than tearing around all the time trying to get things done
B,Ya
A,Anyway I must tell you about the first time I cooked for my husband before we were married
B,Uhm uhm
A,Okay he was my boy-friend then
B,Ya uh huh
A,And what happened was it was so funny
A,I wanted to impress him and at that time I was in the States you see
B,Uhm
A,So oh
A,Okay I bought cooking
A,I bought this book entitled uhm Chinese cooking A to Z or step-by-step or something you know really simple
A,It was so funny I followed it practically step by step but took so long to read each step and the similar instructions you know
B,Uhm
A,Before I went on to the next one that things just went crazy like the first step was to heat up oil in the wok
B,Ya
A,and let the oil heat up before you throw in the garlic you see
A,But I took so long reading the next few steps that the oil kept heating until when I threw in the garlic the garlic simply went black
B,Oh
A,ya everything was terrible and I didn't know that you had to separate broccoli into flowerets you know
B,Uhm
A,You have to slice off the stem
B,Did you put the whole thing in
A,I just I mean broke off great big chunks you know and I didn't know you had to
B,Yeah
A,chop off the stalk <unclear> word </unclear> and there was this great big green things you know uhm trying to cook
A,And I didn't know that it mattered which part of beef you bought you see
B,<unclear> word </unclear>
B,Uhm uhm
A,which cut of beef for es especially for stir-frying
B,ya
A,you should try to buy steak
B,Uh huh
A,you shouldn't just buy cube beef or you know stewing beef
B,Ya ya I'm not very good at that either
B,Uhm
A,I've bought stewing beef which just because really tough the whole time to stir-fry it
B,Uhm
A,So that was really a meal to remember
A,You know the broccoli was great big chunks the garlic was all black
B,So was he impressed
A,and the beef what
A,He kept saying not bad not bad but I noticed he didn't eat very much except for the rice
B,Uhm
A,Ya so but I've come a long way I think
B,Ya what do you cook now
A,Uhm my husband's favourite is mango beef
B,Oh interesting
A,Oh it's really delicious
B,Uhm uhm
A,It's supposed to be a Cantonese dish you know but I haven't uhm met any other Cantonese who who's heard of
B,I bet it's a Cantonese dish in those easter uh no western eastern type of cookbooks right
A,Oh western eastern
A,Well it was written by a Chinese lady
B,who's been at the west
A,in the States for a long time
B,Ya
A,Well she claims it's a Cantonese dish
A,Anyway it tastes really nice
B,Oh uhm
A,It's just like stir-frying beef like you would uhm stir-fry oyster sauce beef or anything
B,Ya
A,but uhm the seasoning is slightly different
B,Uhm
A,Uhm you don't use so much oyster sauce you use a bit more uhm all sorts of things
B,Yep
B,Wine and all that
A,Dark dark soya sauce
A,Ya a bit of this a bit of that
B,Ya
A,some spices
B,Uhm
A,and you actually cook the mango too

A,Oh okay
B,Ya
A,Well my cookbook gives all the
B,uh a dialect breakdown

A,So now my next great ambition is to steam a fish all by myself
B,Oh whoa
A,I can tell you're impressed
A,Oh
B,Ya I normally do uhm well
B,It's a I I normally do the more western type of dishes
A,Uhm uhm

A,It's easy
B,It's very easy
B,So what I
A,Oh casseroles and
B,That's right
A,Oh <unclear> word </unclear>
B,I'll just dump everything into the pot and then put it in the oven and it's ready
A,It's very convenient

A,Ya
B,So uhm
A,What sorts of casseroles do you do
B,Oh all types uhm beef vegetables chicken stew
A,Beef
B,Ya beef casserole like beef stew
A,Wait a minute

A,Oh actually since you have a crockpot now you probably will
B,Might be useful huh
A,'A' because my mother has a crockpot
B,Ya
A,And the first time she did all kinds of stews using different kinds of meats and they always came up wonderful
B,Oh okay
A,Ya so you'd probably find your beef stew really delicious you know if you try doing it
B,Ya I haven't thought of using the crockpot for stews you know
A,Oh oh I mean it's the
B,Silly
A,I mean it's the one you know thing typical dish for the crockpot

B,Ya
A,I'm going to be preparing my courses my course not my courses
B,Ya

A,my course and then because I'm somewhat new at teaching it's uhm I tend to have to over-prepare just to make sure that I feel sufficiently confident
B,Uhm
A,when I'm facing the class
B,Ya
A,So I guess uhm it's a combination of all these factors that's making me so terribly busy right now
B,Ya can imagine

A,I don't know what to call it uhm it's it's a question of revising the first draft
B,Uhm uhm
A,but revising is a really heavy deal
B,Ya
A,It's a really really heavy draining consuhming activity
B,<unclear> word </unclear>
B,Yep uhm
A,Ya because I mean it's so I mean your thesis has to be so finely tuned
B,Ya
A,and then and then uhm in an extended work when you change anything because the arguhments and the line of reasoning is so intensely involved
B,Right ya
