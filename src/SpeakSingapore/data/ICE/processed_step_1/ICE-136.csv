A,Good evening and welcome to Talking Point your weekly forum where you can give your views live on air here on Channel News Asia
A,I'm Ida Bachtiar
A,Tonight we are discussing a very real dilemma for many married couples in Singapore having children
A,Population experts are already warning us that we're just not producing enough babies to replace ourselves
A,But more couples these days are choosing to stop at just one or two or even none at all
A,Is it their fast pace lifestyles a demanding career money before family
A,It could be any number of individual factors but a common one could very well be what Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong recently suggested childcare concerns
A,Now how much does this stop couples from having more children
A,Do take part in our discussion by calling 6910028
A,So are you in the same boat
A,Do you think better support services will help after all grand parents aren't available to baby-sit and you can't afford or you are not comfortable in hiring a maid
A,What are your options really
A,Please share your comments and questions with us by calling at 6910028
A,And here to give their perspectives we have in the studio nominated MP Dr Jennifer Lee and Associate Professor Ngiam Tee Liang from the National University of Singapore
A,We'll be back with your calls stay with us
A,Welcome back to Talking Point
A,Our focus tonight what's keeping Singaporeans from having more children
A,Are childcare problems the issue and what more can government authorities and companies do to help
A,To share their views and answer some of your questions is Dr Jennifer Lee NMP and CEO of KK Hospital and Associate Professor Nigam Tee Liang from the NUS Social Work and Psychology department
A,Thank you so much for coming into studio
A,Before I begin our discussion perhaps I could read to you some of the emails that we have gotten seems to be quite a heart-felt topic
A,We have uh an email here from Daphanie Chng
A,She says I'm a full-time working mother of a six-month-old baby girl
A,The financial status of my husband and I don't allow us to engage a maid plus we don't feel safe leaving the maid alone with our baby so my mother currently looks after her during the day
A,But she's not willing to live with us so we have to travel about two and a half hours everyday and in the end we don't get much we don't get to interact much with our baby
A,We're also worried my mother's surroundings might not be giving my baby best influence
A,We believe as parents we should give our best and we'd like to have more kids
A,Because of this we are now thinking twice
A,There's another email also from Kenny and Kenny says here
A,I believe the drastic drop in fertility rates can be attributed to an increase in well-educated highly qualified women
A,Unlike a decade ago our globalised economy has forced numerous women to venture out of the home
A,As the traditional stereotyped of wives carrying a baby in one arm and a mop in the other is eradicated we are seeing more cases of Singapore women holding top jobs in MNCs
A,Well clearly times has changed and right you know most people are not looking towards having children to look after them I their old age
A,Women don't need to have children to prove that they are worth something
A,What then are we looking at
A,Is Singapore going to see this uh as an increasing trend of women not wanting to have children
A,What is what's your feelings about it
B,Uh well I think the uh figures are there for us
B,I track them very closely because uhm you know more babies are good for us talking about KK Hospital
B,Uh very purely selfish reasons but yes uhm you can see that the trends are the fertility rates has gone down and despite all our efforts it continues to be that way
B,Uh it's a multi- <unclear> word </unclear> problem so I don't think there's any simple answers and I think what we'll be talking about childcare that's definitely one of the issues but not the only one
A,Yes
A,We have two callers already waiting to join us in studio
A,If you may I'd just like to go to them too
A,Hi you're with Talking Point
A,May I know who is that please
C,Hello yah good evening
A,Hello good evening
C,Yes I am Raymond Yip
A,Hi Raymond what would you like to say
C,Just want to comment uh thing is that I think the uhm of course everyone knows the problems uhm that you know uhm that prevent people from having more children
C,One of the main concerns is uh is the childcare issue which is very important to families especially families wanted the best of their children
C,The other thing of course with childcare expenses is not cheap so it's very high
C,For those who have two or even three children
A,Uh uhm how many do you have
C,Two two myself
A,Are you planning to have another one
C,Uh very concern about the financial situation
A,Right
C,And the help uh in fact nowadays the in-laws and parents are very reluctant to chip in to help
A,Right
C,So uh I'm concern more on the financial aspect where even uh I know of friends who having three children even uh the mother herself have to quit the job for three to four years to stay home
A,Okay
C,<unclear> word </unclear> that is really taxing on the husband
A,Right
A,Raymond thank you very much for joining us thank you
A,We have another caller on the line
A,Hi you're with Talking Point may I know who's that please
D,Hello
A,Yes hi could you speak up a little bit
D,Hi this is Joanne Yap
D,I'm calling about this third child issue because I'm currently expecting my third child and she's due to arrive already in January but up to now I'm quite surprised to find out that the government is not supporting us with any maternity leave at all
D,So I really hope that the government body would try and impose this rule so that <unclear> word </unclear> because knowing that if nobody should say it's a compulsory thing no companies would give it to any mothers
D,This is a fact so if the government can look at it it's like a <unclear> word </unclear> thing like uhm if a women having a third child goes away on maternity they can somehow get some kind of maybe like rebates from the government or whatsoever then <unclear> word </unclear> encourage women to have more children I guess
A,Okay thank you very much for joining us thank you
A,So we've a situation where the government is saying this there's just not enough people having babies so like scholars said you know it's like national service
A,At the same time we're facing two issues here uhm financial concerns and childcare concerns
A,What is your feeling about the way the policy are instituted in Singapore
A,Is there enough being done
E,It is true that the policy so far that's been implemented by the government has actually to meet sometimes what we called multiple conflicting objectives because on the one hand you would want to have more birth but it is how you try to encourage
E,So the tax incentives are there no maternity leave for the third child but uh you could have your tax breaks but that is only for those who are paying income tax
E,So it is a concern for those who would like to have more but they don't seem to be in that income bracket that the government has in mind
E,And this is where we have to turn to other measures other than just a physical incentives
E,And uh it does mean relooking at the whole package of childcare subsidies for your children to be in childcare centres uh the operating costs and of course more importantly the community support system
E,I think so far we have not touched on this area where in the past it has been quite uh accepted traditional way in which you have uh child-minder in the neighbourhood you have got uh local babysitters
E,Uhm that is a big issue that we need to actually address
B,I think uhm I think three parties need to get involve in this
B,We Singaporeans are firstly we always think of government pitching to help in one way or the other
B,But I think also companies in terms of uh family friendly policies and I think also individuals
B,Uhm if we talk first perhaps about companies uhm I think in developed countries there is an awareness of uh the need to retain women in the workforce
B,And uh there are quite a few companies now more and more who have put in who pay a lot attention to having family friendly practices
B,And the there are there is a whole range of of these but the most important would be uhm two things
B,One is flexibility in working arrangements so that it's easier for people to manage working moms to manage flexi-time part-time you know tele working things like that
B,Uhm the second big thing is of course would be onsite childcare centres
B,So if you have a combination of these that would help
B,But I think we also have to be realistic about uhm you have to convince companies to do this
B,And uhm I I personally feel and for KK Hospital especially because we have eighty-seven per cent women and it is very important for us to retain you know women in the workforce working with us even after they have kids
B,Uhm there are things that you can do but you need to be convinced that it make sense ultimately to the company that you are not in any way going to affect productivity or <unclear> word </unclear>
B,But uhm what people don't realise I think is the cost of losing a well-trained experienced skilled person
B,The the is not just a matter of going out to interview you know to advertise interview and recruit
B,Is that whole cycle of training someone uhm of the drop in service uhm levels as you are having some new young person onboard
B,So I think if we could have some work done that could convince local companies that this is something that is important for them to look at then that would be very good
A,I'd like to go into that a little further
A,We have another caller though joining us
A,Hi you're with Talking Point
A,May I know who is that please
F,Okay I'm Chandra from Telok Blangah calling
A,Hi Chandra
F,Yes my point is that uh you know there are so much emphasis on children and all that nowadays
F,And if the mother is not at home to look after the kid I think I'm afraid there is this problem of latch-key kids coming up here
F,So uh this is very much seen in today's scenario in Singapore especially
F,So I think uh parents are very afraid to have another child coming to this world when there is no one to really properly care for it you know in terms of real parental care
F,And that's the main problem that people are facing in having another child
A,Right and having the wife not work is not uh a solution either
F,Yes exactly
A,Okay thank you very much for joining us Chandra
F,Thank you
A,Thank you
F,Bye bye
A,So even if we solved the problem by getting your employers to uh somehow you find a way to lobby that uhm you're still spending time away from work uh away from your child
A,At the same time you also need to work because you need to earn the income for your child
A,What are we looking at then you know we have this conflicting uhm aspirations in in women nowadays
A,You know they want to work and want to have a child
A,Do you see this as something that can be resolved </I>
