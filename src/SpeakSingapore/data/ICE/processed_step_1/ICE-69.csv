B,Actually I need only I only need two <unclear> word </unclear>
C,Then why are you doing two
B,Kay poh
A,How expensive
B,The rest got to do it my own lor
C,There's a conspiracy going on which I know about Uhm really not going ah
A,No I'm sure to sleep there
C,That's what I'm worried about actually
A,I might as well do something productive
B,That means you want to skip the lecture
B,You also
C,Cannot cannot
C,If I skip also then nobody is going to go there
B,You you send one rep
A,Aye just like the case of last year that time at first so many then we count
B,So boring the lecture
C,It's not terribly boring
C,I don't think so
C,It's just that the voice or tone he has the the tone of voice he adopts
B,Who is the lecturer
C,No no
A,Cannot say
C,Why should you destroy his reputation
C,He's an internationally known figure okay
B,Who who <unclear> word </unclear>
C,And furthermore he's yet to grade me right
C,No lah
C,It's not that he's really marked you know
C,It's just that the tone is too monotonous
C,Right after a while you
B,It's just like one of the Chinese lecturers
C,Really
B,Hah
B,You know that
A,What what's his name
C,Now there's another conspiracy that I know about
C,I think he's uhm he's he's very nice person
C,When he speaks he's much better in tutorials actually
B,<unclear> word </unclear> they all not impress
C,Uhm
B,Are are you going
C,Probably
A,On our behalf
C,Must be lah or else he look around and can't find me and then what
A,Borrow your your tutorial to record
B,Ya it's a good idea <unclear> word </unclear> taping
C,Taping
C,No I don't think it works very well
A,And it takes time to to listen you know <unclear> word </unclear> to do the transcript
C,Decipher ya
B,But actually nothing to say right especially for Econs lecture
B,You just copy everything from transparency
A,The thing is he doesn't have comprehensive transparencies
C,The guy survives on two transparencies per lecture
B,Two transparencies
B,If that is a good trans
A,You know how he lecture or not
A,Dictation
B,Oh take out a book read read read read read
A,Full-stop
A,All his sentences is very well phrased <unclear> word </unclear>
A,It's very difficult to to catch
B,Econs eh
B,It's not language or others like History or Geography
C,No
C,The thing is he he reads like he writes
B,<unclear> word </unclear> Don't tell me that he just take out one textbook and read from the textbook
A,It's not a text
A,It's his own
C,No
C,It it it he prepared he prepared the thing you see but he reads the way he writes
A,That means once we get hold of that book it's gone already
B,Just knock at his door sir may I have
C,No he'll throw it at you literally throw it at you
C,No it's just that
A,I I think this is not a very suitable topic
A,It's a very interesting topic
C,You have any help
C,This is what grads talk about all day
B,Interesting
C,No I've always find him a very nice person you see
C,When you have something he really meant you know so much
C,It's just that he reads you see and that makes us very hard to copy down
C,Because by the time he gets to the middle of the sentence I just got to the middle of the sentence you've already lost it
C,He could finish it but we can't
A,And the words are not simple
C,That's why I said he reads as he writes
C,When you're writing
B,Use symbols
B,Use symbols
A,Symbols
B,Like for example change you draw a tri one triangle
A,No different
C,No no
A,This kind we are used to he use
C,He use bombastic words
A,Ah so how you change it to symbols
A,Bomb draw a bomb
C,I think more time to draw a bomb then to write the word
B,Actually for example he says something that you are not very sure about the word lah then I don't how to say is you try to form the words lor
C,No actually actually we know the words most of the time
A,We know you see
A,We can't
C,It's just that we send it takes so much to write the word
B,Make it short lor
A,The sentence is full of complicated words so you need to write all the words before that sentence can come out
A,You cannot shorten it then it'll lose the meaning
B,Then shorthand lor
B,This is the only solution
B,Yes serious
C,Why don't you just decide <unclear> word </unclear> to sneak into his room and sort of pinch the book
A,A E also can't finish can learn shorthand
B,Aye do you know that I use shorthand for my Chinese lecture
B,Do you know that
C,Everybody use shorthand
A,No his is professional shorthand
C,No
B,Shorthand
C,For Chinese I thought it's what we call short forms
A,Shorthand not short forms
A,Shorthand
C,I don't ben <unclear> word </unclear> you
A,Prove prove
B,You want to see my Chinese lecture notes

B,I think it's missing <unclear> word </unclear>
B,It's in a hurry
B,It's not with me now
C,Next time next time don't worry there's always time

C,You own set is it
B,My own set
