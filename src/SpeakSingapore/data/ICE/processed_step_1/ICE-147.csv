A,In Cuba politics of staying of alive and watching television how it may be the best thing for Malay students all these and more in the next twenty minutes
A,Hello and welcome to AM Singapore I'm Shanji Dabarachaji
A,The latest ceasefire the eighth in the Croatian conflict appears to be still holding out and well this may have given the negotiators time for both sides to broker for a more lasting peace that time may be running out
A,Although the Yugoslav armed forces have agreed to lift their blockade of seven ports in return for an end to a Croatian siege they haven't however agreed to withdraw from Croatia
A,Also at six o'clock this morning there were reports of mortar clashes in the eastern Croatian towns of <unclear> word </unclear> and <unclear> word </unclear>
A,Given such ceasefire violations Peck Siok Lian asks Steven <unclear> word </unclear> whether the people who put their names to the agreement actually had any control over the forces on the ground <X>
A,SP </X>
B,Well the ceasefire agreement seems to have avoided a major issue by not making any mention of the Croatian demand for a total withdrawal of federal troops from the republic
B,Does this mean that there will be uh negotiations leading to a re-drawing of the internal boundaries of Yugoslavia <X>
B,SP </X>
B,But uh by not going along with the Croatians don't you feel that uh the Serbians are in fact adamant on making uh herself the dominant republic in Yugoslavia and therefore uhm working towards what has been called the greater Serbian nation <X>
B,SP </X>
A,And that was Steven Pavlovich from the University of Southampton
A,Socialism or death
A,Well that rather ominous question was Fidel Castro's defence of communism
A,But when a country hold its fourth party congress later today the question is one of survival the survival of a dying breed of orthodox socialism and the survival of a Castro regime
A,When the two thousand or so delegates meet today their main task is to draw up a blueprint for the island socialist system rather than dish out magical remedies for the crumbling Cuban economy
A,<unclear> word </unclear> is Chief of a Hispanic division at the US Library of Congress in Washington D.C.
A,Producer Tan Yong Meng asked him how the recent announcement of possible cut in Soviet aid to Cuba could affect its economy as well as the congress proceedings <X>
A,CB </X>
C,So in the light of this how closely do you think the Cubans will be watching for changes in the party congress that's starting later today <X>
C,CB </X>
C,Do you expect Fidel Castro to institute any kind of reforms if uh to just satisfy these uh expectations <X>
C,CB </X>
C,But is there a serious challenge at this moment to his leadership do you think <X>
C,CB </X>
C,So given the rather severe economic conditions at the moment how long do you think that Fidel Castro can hold off public discontent <X>
C,CB </X>
A,Col Blazier on the future of Fidel Castro's socialist Cuba
A,In a moment spending too much time in front of the television we find out why Malay parents may approve
A,In November last year teleview launched the first supplementary material and revision tutorials better known as SMART and the aim to provide comprehensive syllabus of revision materials for primary school students
A,The first SMART lessons were in English Mathematics and Science
A,Then about six weeks ago the Chinese SMART lessons were launched
A,Yesterday the Malay SMART program was introduced this has paved the way for the implementation of SMART lessons using teleview's new interactive learning system or I uh or ILS
A,The Malay SMART will be the first to use the system
A,Mrs Goh Kwan Kwan teleview's resident product manager explains to <unclear> word </unclear> just how interactive the system can be in teaching languages
D,These systems allowed some the computer to mark the answers keyed in by the students and it will keep the scores
D,That means immediately after you finish the lesson it will tell you whether the answer is correct or wrong
D,If it is correct they'll be given one mark for the questions and at the <unclear> word </unclear> at the end of the lesson they will give you a total score and give you the ranking
E,Are you say that the students can be ranked using this system
E,How are they ranked with whom
D,With all those who have locked in the teleview who have tried the particular lessons all those people who sign in the system know who you are okay
D,So they will know uh this is your first attempt of this the questions or this is the second attempt of this of the of the set of questions
D,So let's say you score ten out of twenty very likely your score will be in the fifteenth fiftieth position it'll provide some uh motivation for some of the students maybe not all that want to be always on the top and uh at the same time it provide convenience that means you can stop anytime at their own pace
D,So let's say if you uh this lesson have ten questions okay you have finished until six question and you have to you know have to stop for some reason and the next time you come back it he knows that you stop at the tenth lesson and he will give you the eleventh lessons for you to continue to complete the lessons
E,Can the system tell him where he's gone wrong
D,So far the Malay lessons that we have uh uh prepared uh didn't show that because uh the teacher think that it's not necessary at this point in time because it's a little bit simple
D,Maybe for the future lessons we will uhm have another uh page to show them uh if you're wrong why you are wrong and what is the corrections uh
E,In a classroom situation when the student finds it very difficult to learn a language in what ways can this interactive system encourage him to learn a language
D,The teachers that uh write this particular lesson uh they are experts in this area okay and they know they know how to use interactive uh colourful graphics uh sometime even crossword puzzle to attract them
D,Uh we also give bonus to the student who complete the lessons
E,Now in language learning pronunciation is very important how does the system help a student pronounce the words properly
D,We have another package on teleview that has voice respond voice output in fact it is the digitized <unclear> word </unclear> human voice
D,All the teleview user can download this program and get a voice card and they can have a voice output and it will be very effective for learning uh language spoken language
A,Mrs Goh Kwan Kwan teleview's resident product manager and from acquiring a language to learning love acceptance and responsibility
A,Find out how pre-schoolers here are gaining these values next on AM Singapore <X>
A,TC </X>
A,That was Tan Chuen a four year boy with cerebral pulsy singing a song he had just learned in school
A,Tan Chuen is one of the six disabled children who have been integrated into regular preschools with the help of assisted integration supporter or <unclear> word </unclear>
A,The two year uh the two year pilot project is set up by the Singapore Counselor of Social Services
A,It hopes to study the feasibility of integrating physically disabled children between the ages of two and five into existing pre-schools
A,At present <unclear> word </unclear> is providing consultative and therapeutic support <unclear> word </unclear> preschools
A,It hopes to however to involve more centres and to have a total of forty disabled students in regular pre-schools by the end of two years
A,Karen Won ask Judy Hills the project director whether such a setting was the most conducive environment for a disabled child <X>
A,JH </X>
F,But in a regular pre-school teachers are not trained in working with the special needs children so uhm will this actually hamper the handicapped child's learning process <X>
F,JH </X>
F,Will the lessons uh have to be adapted with the presence of uh handicapped child in the school <X>
F,JH </X>
F,But the teachers will have to pay more attention to this uh special needs child so will the other children uh actually get less of a teaching time <X>
F,JH </X>
F,Can you be sure that when the child moves out of this preschool there will be actually uh kindergarten or even a primary school who might be willing to take the child on <X>
F,JH </X>
A,<unclear> word </unclear> is a teacher in one of the pre-schools under <unclear> word </unclear>
A,According to her bringing the two groups of children together has had a positive effect on the behaviour of the pre-schoolers
G,Ah the rest of the kids at first they are very uhm they more they tend to fight more and with Wan Yi around they tend to help and I see their other side of them you know the good side all that instead of just the naughty side
G,They are very nice they play with Wan Yi very well and I saw that they are they can talk to her and they play with her very well and they help her whenever like if she fell down they help to pick her up and if let's say she cannot colour very well they try to tell Wan Yi that you're supposed to colour this way you're supposed to paint this way they help her they become very helpful and they're very responsible kids now
H,He's more vocal he's able to relate stories to me what he has done and uh he's uh more independent in terms of social behaviour he does things on his own
H,Uhm prior to that when he was uh at the uh uh special school he was not that responsive responsive I've to do things for him
H,I guess the children there they don't talk very much and uh uhm so right now when he's uh in this school he plays with the kids the kids they talk to him and he picks up words from them
H,Uhm and I guess the uh the kids benefit too in terms uh you know when they interact with handicapped child with the children like Tan Zhen they are more caring helpful and uh I guess the it it remove the stigma that people have uh you know uh uh towards handicapped to towards the handicapped
A,And that was Mrs Shuen Tan talking about the benefit of integration for her physically disabled son
A,That report was compiled by Karen Won and on that young note we have to the end of today's edition of AM Singapore
A,Join me Shanji Dabarachargi with with producer Peck Siok Lian and Tan Yong Meng tomorrow for more of the stories behind the news
A,Till then have a nice day </I>
A,28 June 1992 </X>
I,And sport tonight starts with results the National Bowling Championship and congratulations are in order as Grace has taken the title in the women's section
I,I believe it's the first time you've won the title since taking up the sport eight years ago
J,Yes indeed and I'm absolutely thrilled
J,I've often been teased by my fellow bowlers to be only interested in uh major the tournaments abroad
J,Should the troupe be told that I actually faced a lot of home ground pressure uhm bowling in Singapore and I guess the big pool of talent out there uh adds on more pressure and it also probably stemmed from the fact that I won my first tournament in nineteen eighty four six months into the sport
I,Uhm was there any particular reason why you were doing so much better in the international titles than in the national games
J,I guess uhm psychologically I was better prepared and being a local tournament uhm I I have not prepared myself well enough over the years and having four years of experience behind me and international exposure there's no reason for me not to do well any more locally
I,But uh uhm what are your plans now
J,Well I'm looking forward to the Asian FIQ which which would be held in August in in Perth and also the major uhm big event South East Asian Games next year and Singapore will be hosting the SEA Games next year and I'll be going for my third masters title so hopefully I will be prepared then 'cos I have a whole year to do that <X>
I,Good luck
J,Thank you </X> </I>
