B,He slept the whole day on my mother's bed
B,Oh well he found a new place to sleep and then not only that in the evening when Sandy was eating don't know what he did he went near Sandy

A,Was there blood or anything
B,Ya there was
A,Oh
B,He has recovered from his fever
B,He's not eating as well though

A,Uhm
B,So when hopefully he is going to eat more and become and strong cat
A,Uhm
B,He is sneezing at the moment and it's so funny
B,You know he behaves just like a human being the way he looks at you

A,Aiyoh
A,Ya lah your cats are so lucky lah
B,Hah
A,The animals who live in your house are just just so lucky
A,They must have been
B,They must have had very good lives
B,That is all
A,Ya I was going to say they must have been good human
A,No they couldn't have been good human beings cause then they wouldn't have been animals right
B,No there is another theory that you cannot sort of uh you cannot sort of uh dig <unclear> word </unclear> what
B,Is there such a word as degress re regress
A,Uh ah
B,Regress from a human being to a animal
A,You cannot uh
B,No
A,Oh means you can come back as another human being
B,Ya but you will have a more difficult life to
A,I see you cannot come back as an animal
B,No you can't
A,I have been telling my students cause we are doing religions right
A,So I mean my understanding is if you you if you are mean in this lifetime you come back as a cockroach or something like that
A,So I was telling them
B,No no
A,Ya
A,See I am telling them wrong things
B,<unclear> word </unclear> coming back as a cockroach but have a harder time as a cockroach
A,Oh aiyah
A,That is so silly
A,I mean I mean which cockroach has a good time
A,Which cockroach sleeps on a bed
A,Know what I mean
B,Oh ya I have heard there are some
A,But not in that sense
B,You <unclear> word </unclear> talk about it
B,It is like why like everyone has like a set of like seven cards in life
B,How is that your set of cards are different from the set of cards that someone in Calcutta has who sleeps on the road
A,Uhm uhm
B,You know what I mean
B,It is like
A,I think some things cannot be explained
A,I mean I wouldn't want to try to explain it
B,I mean
A,I I don't think that
B,In other words I mean if there is a life before it is possible it may not be possible but I think <unclear> word </unclear> it's just a theory
B,But it is quite likely you know that there should be cleared <unclear> word </unclear> live <unclear> word </unclear> before if that explains why you know our Lord now
A,No I don't think so lah
B,Ya there it it explains what they cannot change Like for example you know our family
B,Why are we born into certain family
B,Things like that
B,Ya
B,Uhm social economic sort of you know conditions
B,But of course that you can come out of it too
A,Uhm uhm
B,You know and there have been cases of like you know like Tan Tock Seng was a hawker
A,Uhm uhm
B,<unclear> word </unclear> vegetable seller
B,Well this is a hawker I guess same
B,And uh you know and then he went rich <unclear> word </unclear>
A,There are lots people like that
A,From rags to riches kind of story
B,Not lots lah Carol
A,Quite a lot right I mean
B,I mean there are
A,Just that we don't know like especially those back those from China and all that
B,Ya
A,When they in to first work Now they they have they own land and
B,<unclear> word </unclear> Carol no
A,Buildings and stuff
B,Historical evidence shows uh shows that uhm historical evidence uh points to the fact that very few actually have made to to the upper echelon
B,Most most of the collies that came here well maybe they became middle class over
A,uhm uhm
B,Generations but they didn't like become rich overnight
A,Not overnight lah of course not overnight
A,They worked very hard
B,They as <unclear> word </unclear> individuals did did not
A,Uhm uhm
B,But their their the generation that follow after them
A,Uhm
B,Ya so you have got very few cases like people like Lok Yoon uh Tan Tok Seng
B,They came from China
B,Now very few of those who like come out make it to the top
A,Uhm uhm
B,Very few
B,It is more likely that their descendants
A,Uhm
B,Hopefully do something about it
A,Uhm uhm
B,Ya
A,I suppose
B,Ya
A,Well our pastor don't believe in reincarnation
B,Uhm
A,Ya
B,Ya I think it is possible
A,I don't think so
