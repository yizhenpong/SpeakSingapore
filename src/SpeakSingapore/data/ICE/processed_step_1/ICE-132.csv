A,I think it's true that uh in the market there is general perception that the prices may begin to to move down and the I think this perception is uh due to too many expectations
A,One is that there seems to be coming on-stream over supply of uh residential property and secondly there seems to be a consensus that the economy may be weakening
A,My own opinion is that uh the market will probably be stable for at least a few more months after which uh it may begin to ease but not very much <X>
A,Martin </X>
A,Perhaps uh five per cent which is what I said before uh
B,Well I think uhm basically uhm everybody is now on the side lines waiting and personally I think the property market is really toppish because I think uh if you look between 1985 and now the prices have gone up probably close to three times so the I I believe the upside potential is limited and I think the prices should come down as uh Dr Amos said five to ten per cent
C,Well uhm from historical record in fact we have seen that the rate of increase in prices have started to drop since about end of 89 so even though there is an increase over all these months the rate of increase has been dropping so that seem to suggest that we are also heading also for downward uh uh movement of the price <X>
C,Martin </X>
C,I think well it's anybody's guess
C,It could be five
C,It could be ten
B,Well I have a different opinion from all the other three
B,Uh we are more bullish uhm having crunched our numbers we realise that yes prices have gone up considerably since 1985 or 86 but then at the same time so has uhm income of Singaporeans uhm so the actual affordability has actually improved
B,Uhm the other factors to consider would be the fall in interest rates here
B,Against that you've got relatively higher yield on rental of say condominium apartments and there's also foreign factor
B,You've mentioned Hong Kongers but uh I think there's another factor to consider which is the shortage of local professionals in the work force here which means that there'll be a continued strong influx of expatriates to meet that short fall <X>
B,Martin </X>
B,Yes I'm bullish <X>
B,Martin </X>
B,I think prices will remain at current levels for say another four to six months and there after people will start to come back again because the longer prospective buyers prospective cash-up buyers wait the more anxious they are about possibly missing the bottom of the market <X>
B,Martin </X>
B,Yes I think he is very optimistic
B,Uhm basically he mentioned about the increase in income
B,Well uh I think if you look at the increase in income versus the increase in property prices over the last five years uhm you know as I mentioned property prices have gone up by more than three times but certainty income didn't go up in terms of in that proportion so uhm uhm I think he is pretty optimistic
B,
B,Well but the other factor to consider is capital gains from those who are now in public housing
B,If you have bought a say five-room HDB flat five years ago at around five years ago at around hundred thousand dollars today you could sell it for easily two hundred thousand dollars
B,So with that and the uh increase in income in salaries since then most couples should be able let's say a significant number of uh household in public housing would be able to upgrade to private <X>
B,Martin </X>
A,Uh I think I have to to step back a bit ICE-SIN:S1B-032#> Uh assuming that we are at the peak it doesn't mean that the this is not the a good time to buy
A,Uh generally speaking prices are expected to move down uh later part of the year
A,But uh assuming that you are careful in your choice of property uh if you buy at the peak a very good quality property in a good location uhm from historical trends we have seen that actually although the property market moves in cycles uh every cycle is higher than the than the previous
A,And if you buy at the peak and you are willing to have a longer term investment horizon to hold on uh to say around the next peak
A,Uh in fact historically we have found that the rate of growth for capital appreciation has been quite good you have six seven per cent <X>
A,Martin </X>
A,We are basing uh our projections mainly on the possible supply situation
A,In fact we agree with Yew Boon that the demand is strong but the price being quite high tends to dampen demand because uh it acts as a ceiling from people's perception
A,But uh supply is still a very fundamental uh component uh of of of factor of price and looking at uhm landed property as compared with condominiums the supply for condominium would be we estimate for the next two or three years about thirty per cent or above say thirty to forty per cent over supply compared to landed property of about fifteen to thirty per cent
A,So looking at this just from the supply point of view there seems to be uh perhaps a greater amount of oversupply for apartments and therefore there maybe a greater down side for apartments compared to landed property <X>
A,Martin </X>
A,Uhm well now it's it's uh let's let's look at the question from the point of view of uh uh growth right
A,Uh I was saying that the the the long-term trend is one of a growth in the property prices so if you if you are willing to hold long-term then you could say that even at the the peak it is not the wrong time to buy provided you are very careful in choosing good quality property alright
A,On the other hand you say let's let's wait until it slides ten fifteen or even twenty per cent or let me wait wait until the market is down but we know generally that it is when the market is high that you do get people selling good property in good locality this which are perhaps with uh well secured tenants and if you wait for say the bottom of the market now you may be scrapping the bottom barrel <X>
A,Martin </X>
B,Well uhm I would say it depends on the type of properties that you are looking at
B,Certainly I think apartments you know I feel that uhm there is a potential that it may come down so uhm if you have a pro just now you were mentioning about the the guy wanting to buy the property when to buy and when not to buy it really depends on your time horizon as as uh Dr Amos said you know
B,The other thing is uhm in terms of upgrading if you're buying it for your own owner occupation then you know the timing is less important
B,Because if you were to wait for the down turn you know you maybe never be able to get the property that you like
B,So it really depends on your own personal what you think and the other thing that is very important is your cash flow you know whether your monthly income is able to service the kind of properties that you are buying at <X>
B,Martin </X>
B,Yah I think so <X>
B,Martin </X>
A,For investment meaning that you want to buy to let out
A,At the same time perhaps in a few year's time to sell for capital gain
A,Uh for budget say uhm HDB homeowner possibly if you have budget of say four hundred to five hundred thousand you'll be good to look at uh preferably uh prime districts which we we know nine ten eleven and in fact perhaps fifteen too because these are the areas which are preferred by expatriate management uh staff who require housing and they uh go for these areas and the rentals that you can get probably would would be quite like seven per cent yield
A,Uh advertisement at ten per cent yield seems to be really too perhaps exaggerated <X>
A,Martin </X>
A,Outside prime if you think for investment uh well uhm you may get a yield of six per cent which is not bad uhm but the there is perhaps a a little more difficulty in letting out
C,I think if we look at the uh figures you would see that prices are actually becoming quite uh similar in various district outside the prime area and this trend will go on as the uh island decentralised in its development pattern So in a sense there's really a wide range of districts and areas to buy into
C,What is probably more important for Mr Lim would be to uh make a very careful assessment of his personal needs the needs of the households perhaps accessibility to uh places or place of work uh the schools uh schools for the children and so on
C,So that would be more important <X>
C,Martin </X>
B,Well certainly for investments we look at two things
B,One is the rental and one you know is the capital appreciation
B,Well uhm I think in terms of investments if you are buying a property for investments location is very important uhm location is the important thing that you should be looking at because in terms of appreciation when the market goes up they are the ones to go up fastest and when the when the market they are the the ones to come down fastest
B,And in terms of rentals I think you can get much better rentals and much better sup uh demand by the expatriates
B,So I would say that if you are buying a property for investments you should look for prime location uh res uhm apartments <X>
B,Martin </X>
B,Yes I think so because if you are buying houses let's say for example in this particular person he's he's living in HDB he could opt for a terrace for example because I think like a terrace or semi-detached the prices have gone up much less than would the uh the condos
B,Uh in terms of the price increase I think the the uhm the landed properties have gone up probably about thirty to fifty per cent compared to condos which have gone up about three times so I think in terms of the potential for capital appreciation
B,Certainly I think landed property is a better bet but again you know it depends on your own personal preference <X>
B,Martin </X>
B,I think until the uhm government particular the CPF changes its uh regulations uh the leasehold property would be a safer bet because uhm sorry freehold property I guess uh you know leasehold property uh I think after ten or or twenty years up to close to twenty years the property uh the capital appreciation potential isn't quite there
C,But I think there is a psychological factor at at work because I think we still very much like to own a piece of the turf in Singapore and if you look at the new uh supply coming onto the market that is in private housing than we have almost two-third of it in the form of uh medium price terrace houses
C,But that obviously uh tells you that both the public sector as well as the pri pri private sector is targeting that particular segment of the market
B,Well I think if you have half a million you can easily buy in a terrace in a uhm not so prime location uhm and uh I think you can also you can also buy a small apartment if you want to so uhm there is still market if you have a half million there is still a supply of such properties in the market <X>
B,Martin </X>
B,The only the the the only I think uhm semi-detached have gone beyond half a million except for really off-side locations or very old properties so I think it is really beyond the reach if you have half a million for semi-detached <X>
B,Martin
