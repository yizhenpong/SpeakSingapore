A,But first Singlish on TV
A,With me tonight the people who featured prominently in the recent debate Elaine Ong an undergraduate
A,Elaine wrote to the press last week to say that Singlish should not be used on TV
A,Sidney Wyse a newsletter editor wrote in to agree with her
A,Jacintha Absheganaden entertainer and presenter of Mum's Not Cooking she disagrees with both of them
A,They have slug it down on the papers now we'll get a chance to hear their views direct on TV
A,The question is should we say can we use Singlish or Singlish can or not
A,In any case you're wondering why we're talking about this night
A,Here's why
A,<O> Footage </O>
A,Fairly provocative comment from Kerpal
A,That's a good starting point for our discussion this evening
A,Elaine let me start with you
A,Some people who read your letter to the press to the paper say that uhm you come across as someone quite ashamed of Slinglish
A,Is that a fair comment
B,Uhm firstly I like to say that I don't believe that there is such a thing as Singlish
B,What you call Singlish I would call bad English because a a term like don't shy uhm do you consider that Singlish or bad English
B,What's the difference
C,Who's the arbiter here of of uh of that
C,I mean uh are you saying that don't shy is you're saying don't say don't shy is it
B,Is it bad English or is it Singlish or are they the same thing
C,Does it matter
D,It does actually
C,Why
D,You see when you say don't shy
C,But if I said to you uh Sidney if I said to you uh join me join me don't shy
D,Well that's different
D,Now when you say don't shy it's it's uh it's not correct it's improper and you let you have not actually <unclear> word </unclear>
C,But are you considering that the context in which I'm saying it
D,Well then you may have to explain that to to the viewers
C,I am an entertainer and I am the presenter of a show
D,Well as as an entertainer and a presenter you have two things to think about
D,One children two adults
D,As adults we are quite comfortable with that such languages But as as
C,Language
D,Language I meant
D,Uh but with a child you have a serious problem
C,No it's not my problem Sydney
C,I'm just an entertainer
C,As an entertainer I'm allowed to suspend belief okay because I may not be acting or presenting as myself Jacintha I may be presenting a persona
C,Now that persona within the parameters of the show uh is allowed to uh take on a certain things which are part of entertainment
C,Now entertainment is about magic
C,It's about uhm there are a lot of children now in Singapore who believes that if they go on the living room carpet uh they will fly
B,But I don't think so
B,I don't think so
D,Is is it about gibberish
C,Sorry
D,Is it about gibberish
C,Is it about gibberish Sydney
D,Yes yes
A,Well let let me put it this way
A,Sydney may I may intervene
D,Yes
A,Uhm I think your concern is really very much uh whether children will misunderstand will be misled
D,Misled
A,Is that is that your
B,I don't think children can make the difference They can't they cannot differentiate
A,Okay
D,Growing children would have a a problem there because they will take it as the correct English
A,Will children take it to be the correct English
B,Yes they will
A,Uh what would be the role of parents in trying to direct them accordingly
D,But can you imagine the parent spending every other second correcting their child and say don't follow this don't use it
D,This is incorrect than what the <unclear> word </unclear> show
C,There are many informal situations in the home where Singlish is used
C,You see I feel very much that this discussion is kind of passe really is uh we're we're being a bit old-fashioned here in discussing discussing Singlish in the first place
B,No I think there's a time and place where I use to speak
D,There is a time and place precisely
A,Okay okay let's let's take about that time and place for discussing it
C,The context
A,Uhm so you talk about context and perhaps you can also talk about motivation you know uh why is this person using Singlish and why using this particular thing programme or uh as or or or discussion live discussion as a forum Let's discuss that
A,What did what is appropriate
A,Who decides what's appropriate
C,Uhm that was my question to you
A,Yah
A,Elaine
B,When you said appropriate what do you mean by
C,He asked the question
A,Yah yah I mean for whom is it appropriate
A,Who decides whether this is permissible or not
B,Maybe you should have a body that actually regulates
A,Another body to regulate
D,Not another body
D,I think before you even initiate you
C,I don't think we're talking about language here you see
C,I feel very much that Singlish is not about language it's about a subculture
A,Okay Ja Jacintha maybe we should let uh Sydney complete his thoughts
D,Yes uh I think before we actually initiate uh a programme we have to seek uh the opinion of the majority how they would react
D,And if you if they feel uncomfortable or they feel that the programme is not suitable for the general public don't feature it
C,If this is the way we're thinking about most things in Singapore then uhm you know it might be very very hard to launch many things because we are very kiasu as uhm as Kumar said just now
D,You may be kiasu
C,No no no no
D,But I don't think the majority of the people are kiasu
D,I think there are people
C,How do we do this poll
C,You know nothing will get started we must be spontaneous we should be we should just try
D,You see we don't have to we don't have to put ourselves in an incorrect situation
C,No we're certainly don't
D,So you're agreeing with me that Singlish is is
C,I am not
A,Okay perhaps perhaps we we may not be getting anywhere if we use terms like incorrect because incorrect is really subjective incorrect in what sense
A,Uh if you're using grammar as a as a yardstick yah perhaps in it is it isn't correct
A,But if you are suggesting that oh if we can agree that it is something that's been evolving naturally in Singapore then
C,I have to suggest that
A,We have to see it from a different point of view
A,Let me just put it to you this way
A,If we your concern is children are impressionable they could be misled
D,Yes
A,But there are many other ways perhaps that children could be misled
A,Media is one way so do you think we could end up cloistering them and over protecting them
C,Which was my point in the newspaper that perhaps you know we should be able to learn to laugh at ourselves a liitle bit more and that uh
B,But there should be a time when you have to stop
D,But not like this but not yes
D,But not laugh at the stupidity of ourselves I mean if that
C,Oh no no nobody is suggesting that we're being patronising by using Singlish that's what I mean
C,I don't feel that Singlish is about language and sometimes it's not what you say it's how you say it
C,If I said you as I was saying before uhm join me join me don't shy
C,You might forget that I didn't put the be in it you know but if I said to you join me join don't shy uh it sounds Singlish so sometimes it's the tone in which we speak uh or we use Singlish
D,But you can't understand one thing you are an en an en an entertainment as you mentioned earlier
C,You should understand that
D,Alright and being an entertainer you could easily influence especially the growing children not so much the adult you won't influence me but you will influence the little girl the little boy
D,Now who's responsible for bad English
D,It's you
A,Sydney if I may come in on this
A,Now uhm some people feel in fact quite a few people feel in Singapore that it is closely linked to a to our national identity
A,It is not the national identity but it's closely linked Uh in your letter you did end by saying that treat Singlish as nothing more than a joke
A,Uh were you serious about that
D,I'll be very serious
C,May I set a language example that a hundred years ago a word like perambulator was the standard form usage of what we now know as pram and you know you might a hundred years ago it would be absolutely correct to say excuse me but could you please move your perambulator but now we say excuse me please move your pram
A,Okay okay if that's what you're saying
C,Ah what was slang what was considered slang it's what you are saying now
D,It's just it's just like a typewriter It's just like a typewriter
A,Okay my dear friends my dear friends if if we go this way I don't think we can come to any agreement
A,Not that we should come to an agreement but let me put this question to you is it possible at all for us to come to some form of agreement on this issue some form of agreement and what would that be
A,Let me let me have a very quick comment from each of you
A,Let me start from Elaine Elaine
B,I I don't think so
B,I don't think there's a middle line where you say yes sometimes you use it I mean on the media sometimes you don't in the media but
D,So you feel that there's no way we can agree
D,There's no way we can compromise
B,Either we use it or we don't in the on the media yah
A,Jacintha
A,Can we agree on something on this issue
C,I totally agree that the use of Singlish has to be taken in whatever context me uhm and therefore uh when you say it's use in certain situations it's absolutely correct to use certain in a court I wouldn't say to the judge uh I wouldn't speak Singlish to the judge we have to use
B,Why not uh if you are so proud about uh
C,No no I'm not talking about the two faces of the use of language
D,Quick comment okay
D,Can we just wrap up your thought please
D,We're running out
C,I want to communicate to my fellow Singaporean and in many situations from me to communicate in a friendly
D,Are you underestimating the the ability of the Singaporeans
C,You certainly sound defensive and uncommunicative now in your formal
A,Okay thanks
A,Sydney your <unclear> word </unclear> your thoughts please
A,Do you think we can agree on something here
D,I think that for as long as you want uh I mean for example if if you want to speak English speak it the correct way
D,Now there are times you might
C,Why should you be so pretentious
D,You you might fumble
D,There are times you might fumble but that does not in any way uh put you in a very bad situation
D,But if you deliberately speak Singlish then I think that's bad because you are encouraging improper English
A,Okay
A,Well looks like we really cannot come to any kind of agreement
A,It's an age old debate age old discussion
