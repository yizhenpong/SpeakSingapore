C,Really
A,He or rather no what she actually said was Oh uhm ya he he says he can't really get used to it
A,And she said something to the effect of people prefer the previous length
A,So by inference I took it that he didn't like it that much
C,Oh I thought he liked it and I thought she said he liked it
C,I can't remember
A,Uhm anyway it's very very fresh-looking but
C,Very
A,I don't know I still liked her with even-length hair

A,Oh gosh so you cut it <unclear> word </unclear>
C,Uh huh it's the shortest I've ever had
A,Oh no
A,Is it layered or is it even-length
C,Uhm it's well I'm trying to keep it all over again so it's it's levelled up to half my chin length and then it's a gradual slope down
A,Oh I see
C,Half my chin length
C,Uhm well it's you know what that means right
A,I think I know what that means
A,Uhm uhm
C,Uh
A,Uhm Oh dear

A,Uhm uhm
C,Oh I hear from Sharlene you're going to the London <unclear> word </unclear> Ballet
A,Oh yes that oh that means she's been in the room
C,Uh huh
A,Because you know I've got two tickets to <unclear> word </unclear>
C,Uh huh
A,Uh huh because I I I got thirty dollar tickets and forty dollar tickets
A,So I thought it's easier to sell off the thirty dollar tickets
A,And so I put up a notice on the board in the room
C,Oh you mean you you made a duplicated <unclear> word </unclear>
A,Meaning I bought I had four tickets and I only needed two
C,Oh dear
A,Yes
C,Well you can try Kumu
C,She's kind of idle right now
A,Oh does she like ballet
A,Do you like ballet
C,Yes I do um
A,Ah
C,But when is it
A,Uh this is the twenty-eighth of June
C,Oh so I'll be around eh
A,Uhm uhm
C,Uh huh
C,How much
C,Oh thirty
A,Uhm
C,Oh that's a thought
A,It's up in the circle
A,Uhm one of my friends told me it's okay seats
C,Uh huh
A,Uhm I'll be going with Andrew on the same night
C,Oh on the same night but different seats
A,Yes
A,Uhm uhm just different seats
C,Uhm
A,And uhm ya it's at Kallang
A,It's at eight pm
C,Oh it's the Romeo and Juliet one
A,Uhm yes
C,I was more attracted to the next bill
A,Oh yes
A,The one with Transfigured Night but I think those are completely sold out
C,Uh huh ya
A,Uhm uhm
C,I thought it would be
A,Uhm
C,We tried
C,The only one my friends tried to get was the Dallas Symphony
A,Oh and
C,Tried to get
A,Oh okay
A,Tried to get
C,And then for the rest of it I thought oh give it a skip <X>
A,Uhm uhm Uhm I was talking to another friend who was telling me oh he's going to see the Indonesian dance
C,Uhm uhm
A,in the gamallon and nuh he was saying and he was saying that ya these are the tickets that are more available Then he says Singaporeans are so snobbish
C,Uh
A,and I kind of shrivelled in my feet
C,No
A,Uhm
C,it's not that Singaporeans are snobbish that I think those who are trained to those who go to ballets and all
A,Uhm uhm
C,and music halls they're all western classically-trained So so I I think not exposed enough to indigenous cultural works you know
A,Uhm uhm ya
C,and well
A,Uhm uhm
C,Did I tell you once I went I went with my entire Bible study group to The Glass Orchestra
A,The Glass Orchestra
C,Uh huh and because it's some um experimental group and highly experimental and I kind of knew
A,Uhm
C,that I forgot you see So I said 'Why don't we all go ' and I booked tickets for all of them and they almost died because
A,Oh
C,because the trained ones uh two most accomplished ones almost died because it's like nothing orchestral that they know
A,It was that spaced out
C,Uh huh
A,Uhm
C,and like 'What orchestra ' It's all broken pieces of glass
A,Oh that's why it's called The Glass Orchestra
C,Ya so it's like actually they tried to pattern um the the the glass instruments um most of which were fashioned themselves They tried to to group them into the different sectors you know like the conventional orchestra
A,Uhm uhm
C,according to I don't know the pitch or something
A,Uhm
C,and their works were original too So you've got to like throw away all the conventional ways of listening and listen according to rhythm you know
A,Uhm uhm
C,and I found it very interesting because I could pick out when one movement ended or one piece ended and another girl who's like absolutely tone-deaf sometimes and she's not trained you see and she's not very exposed and she knew when it ended but the musician friends of mine my goodness they just went 'To hell with it'
A,Was it bad Wasn't it enjoyable
C,Um it's enjoyable if you listen to it with a different ear
A,Uhm
C,So they were going 'I like Brahms so what am I doing '
A,Oh poor things
C,Ya but I was quite mad actually because it's like you're you're just cloistered you know instead of broadening
A,Uhm uhm
C,Well uh different different ideas and I think all that talk all that reading up on post-modernism help
A,Uhm uhm Uhm
C,Ya
A,By
C,Uhm
A,By the way
C,Ya
A,this is a recorded conversation
C,Ya I figured
A,Ya
C,By the sound <unclear> word </unclear> she's going to have a lot of giggles Cos' it's something as natural as it can get I can't I can't I can't control it
A,Oh same here
C,Ya I kind of <unclear> word </unclear>
A,How in the world do you transcribe giggles Do you just skip them or do you put in bracket giggle
C,Ya wow wee she's going to have a lot of brackets
A,Wow okay
