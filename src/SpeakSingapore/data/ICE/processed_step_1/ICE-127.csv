A,And staying with the subject of teenagers there has been concern recently over a particular group of teens those labelled problem kids
A,Judging by the figures for juvenile delinquency and a number of young people referred to organisations like Teen Challenge the problem seems to be growing
A,But to understand what's really happening we need to go beyond the statistics and a statement of a social problem into the world of the troubled teenagers themselves
A,Who are they and how can they be helped
A,Well I have with me in the studio three social workers who have lots of experience in dealing with these kind of teenagers
A,Uhm perhaps to start off would you agree that when we say problem teenagers even though it is a label uhm we are referring to specific group of young people you know those with persistent behaviour problems whose parents don't seem to be able to to cope with with them
A,And uh who if we don't sort of help them they could become juvenile delinquents
B,Uh the group that you're mentioning that is only a segment of the whole population of uh teenagers that we need to be aware that inherent aim adolescent development there are certain uh stresses and storms that they have to go through and that require adjustment and coping skills from them
A,But what makes a a a teenager going through normal growing pains become a a so call problem teenager
A,What is that difference
C,I like to see it as a point where the teenager kind of gets to a point where he loses adults supervision whether it be uh the parent as the authority figure or school uh with the teacher of principal and once he loses adult supervision then he will be open to more open to peer influence and that can precipitate uh experimentation that leads to a certain type of behaviour
A,So would you see the the root of the problem may be going back beyond adolescent I mean to the child's uhm early development
A,Is that where it starts
A,Is it a relationship he has or doesn't have with his parents
B,I think that early childhood experiences do have an effect on the uh teenagers
B,I think uh in present Singapore because of the success of our population policy parents see that children are precious resources and therefore they become super-organised or they become too over-protective with their children and so from young they do not allow their children to learn to make choices to make responsible decisions from the for themselves
B,And I feel that if children from young because the decisions they make are normally not that important so if you start from young like learning to choose what kind of clothes I want to wear how much I want to eat what I want to eat I think that will help the children to learn to be independent and to prepare them for self care
A,But what about the group of parents that uhm simply don't have enough time for their children
D,I think parents like it or not they have to spend adequate time with them even if both parents are working which is quite common nowadays
D,So uh the only free time I suppose they have is in the evening and they should try to make most use of it as they can as well as the weekends
D,And uh we <unclear> word </unclear> we do find that there are quite a lot of so called problem kids uh be due in large part to the background both parents working the child may be fostered out and the child may have several foster care takers and parents do not spend enough time to build up the relationship with them
A,Now you uh actually operate the Parentline you actually take calls from parents who think they have problems with their kids right
A,What what do they say to you you know what do they how do they uhm come to you with their problems
D,Okay when they come to us with a problem of a teenage uh they are quite a number of common problems for example kids coming back late staying out running away from home smoking or parents may feel that the kids are too young to have a boyfriend or girlfriend uh these are common problems that they will bring up to us
A,Uhm so what okay what are the things that you would be concerned about
A,I mean uh kids sort of boy-girl relationships there's part of the normal process of growing up right so what would you be concerned about
D,I think I'm more concerned about the rising trend of abortion and uh promiscuity among the young and also the rising trend of suicide among the teenagers too
D,There are quite a number of other problems stresses from uhm pressures of school work uhm what else
A,Okay yah sorry
C,I was I feel that there are are other symptoms that we need to identify
C,I have increasing contact with parents that that indicates that uh the youth begins to show rebellion before they are ten or begin to ask for their freedom uh before their teenage years uh well in advance two three years in advance of their so called teenage years you know
C,So there are some symptoms uh that need to be recognise by the parents early uh and one of them is rebellion in the home
C,The other can be uh low performance uh in school uh grades and of course uh if it comes to the point of misbehaviour in school or truanting or running away from home starting with one night or over the weekend uh to three days to five days these are symptoms of uhm uh problems that are already beginning to arise in the young
A,Right I think that's that's a very important what symptoms you know what actually are these teenagers looking for
A,They're obviously crying out for something what do they need
D,Usually they're asking for independence but from the parents' point of view uh what they would see as a symptom is the lack of control
D,I can't get my kid to listen to me anymore uh he's too demanding and he gets his own way
D,I would think that that is the major symptom that they need to recognise
A,So parents say they don't have enough control over their kids
A,Kids say they don't have enough freedom
D,That's right
A,Is there somewhere for them to meet halfway
B,I think they can negotiate because I think the parents need to realise that uh as a children grow older they as they mature they have uh increasing and better skills
B,You them opportunities to take part in decision-making and to let go slowly
B,And once you give them a chance and if they can show that they can responsibility for themselves and also for the family and the society at large and then they can slowly let go
C,But I I think the the the best way is to uh get uhm through whether it be professional assistance of not but I feel that the parents themselves have ability to bridge that gap
C,It has to be both ways where the parents move toward the problem teenager and the teenager uh at least uh understanding their their needs to be some compromise and they have to work towards each other
A,If they're given and yah given that okay uh a teenager who is going through a this kind of phase that's not uh sort of so called normal uhm is not likely to want to listen to his parents anyway or to any authority figure
A,Uhm is it really realistic to say that we can help the teenager bridge the gap
A,Do you think it's realistic
C,I think yes uh I think teenagers are looking for someone who's willing to listen to what they have to say rather than always have to listen to someone
C,So we need to realise the the the normal transitional experience of a uh transitional stage of a teenager and realise that if someone is identified as on the fringe then more so that young person needs a listening ear
C,And I have found that through my work in Teen Challenge when the teenager realises that someone is willing to give their time to listen they are ready to pour out uh their dreams their ambitions
C,Is not that they want to perform poorly in exams is just that why all the pressure sometimes why I heard one teenager said why should I get straight As you know why must I be like so and so I wanna be myself
A,Right so you're saying that really one should not treat problem teens as different from other teenage problems
C,Yes
D,In a certain sense I I think the start needs to come from the parents because usually they are the one who recognises the problem first and they can learn how to cope and what like Sam says they should be prepared to offer their teens a listening ear and that's where you open up the communication
D,But very often you find that parents are very controlling they're nagging they are demanding and they expect their teens to listen to what they have to say and that's final
C,Now that's very interesting because almost one hundred per cent of all the teenagers we deal with uh indicate that they wish their parents won't nag at them
C,You know in some way not uh just by verbal nagging but they wish that their parents would would be more listening than just
D,more understanding
C,Ah yah and display understanding rather than just tell them
B,So what you're saying is that the parent should be encouraged uh to take the youth through a process of analysing their problem and then they can act as resource persons
C,Exactly yes
B,And it is up to the youth themselves to make the decision as to
C,Exactly
B,What solution is acceptable to them and be held responsible for it
A,Okay
D,Quite often uh you find that uh parents are also too quick to judge
D,Uh they will say the friends that you go with are not very suitable and teens having friends they find their friends important and they find them that is good
D,Uh so parents need to handle these issues sensitively
A,Yah what about okay what about a parent who has never uhm been able to communicate with his or her child has never had the experience of developing that relationship what can that parent do
A,Is it I mean is that sort of relationship beyond redemption
A,Would you ever say that there are cases which are beyond redemption
C,I don't uh state uh that there's there are cases beyond redemption because I've seen many parents get surprise at themselves uh that they had the ability to actually work toward
C,It may not uh change uh overnight it's again gonna be another process of uh learning uh because suddenly they realise I don't understand my teenage daughter
C,Where where was I at all these while
C,Uh and uh then if they can look at that as an opportunity to grow with their now teenage daughter uhm then uh it is possible because they can find the resource within themselves
A,Okay just very quickly as a final sort of comment from all of you
A,There's this organisation in the States called Tough Love which helps parents sort of take a stand with their teenagers and stick to it sort of lay down the law as it were
A,Uhm do you think something like that could work in Singapore Ngee
D,Uh it's very good approach but I don't think it is suited for our culture because what Tough Love advocates is a kind of taking a tough stand letting your kid face the consequences and letting your kid go <X>
D,Parents are not ready for that and like Wah Khoon said their their kid is too precious
C,I feel Tough Love uh only works on a very strong uh bond in in a relationship There has to be a strong bond because uh some of our teenagers in Singapore react at the slighest provocation
