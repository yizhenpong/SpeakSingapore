B,But I already scare her a bit
A,Ya I'm trying to get Lay Peng to come back to help out also

B,Was she working for a degree then or just not
A,No she wasn't she wasn't and they uh actually she was supposed to be hired under him
B,Uhm uhm
A,As an RA but I guess they wanted to save cost and asked her to convert it to a a PhD by research
B,Uhm uhm
A,So she's looking around for a scholarship
B,Oh I see
A,<unclear> word </unclear>
B,Uhm uhm
A,To buy more equipment
B,Uhm uhm

A,Oh why
B,Oh oh actually this week I'm really busy with uh work to complete and I guess I shall miss the fun
A,Oh you mean they've been uhm pushing you and all that
B,No no no but uh there are some things I need to sort of sort out and no I just in the process of sorting out the stats all those uh terrible stats pile so
A,different tests and all that
B,Uhm uhm ya
A,Oh
B,So I thought that I should spend more time on it
A,But don't stay too late
B,Uhm well it's nice
A,But it's quite uh dangerous for you to go out late at night in that sense
B,Not really because I can take the MRT from my uh from the the bus-stop outside the engineering blocks
A,The MRT
B,Uh sorry I mean duh I'll take ninety six and then I'll go the MRT station so it's not that bad
B,It's not like a long walk compared to before and I had to take like one nine seven * 197* one nine eight <&>  198)
A,Uhm ya sounds ya <unclear> word </unclear>
B,Uhm
A,But you still do you still have to walk through that little path with the palm trees and all that
B,Palm trees
B,Uhm
A,or I think coconut trees
B,Oh no no usually I'll go by the uh on the the sixth level where they have the yellow roof you know that part
A,Uh
B,Is it
B,I mean the palm trees is where uhm like near YIH right
A,Ya
B,Uhm I don't go through that way
A,Oh you don't go through that way
B,Nope
A,Oh it's the one that's just uhm opposite arts is it
B,Uhm opposite O what
A,Arts uh uhm central library
B,Uhm ya ya ya right
B,Uhm uhm
B,Ya so in a way it's quite convenient
B,Ya so long as I don't go to the thirty three * 33* bus-stop I feel safer
B,You know the one that's behind
A,The one that's behind
B,Uhm uhm the one that's uhm like you have to go down the long flight of steps and then you go through I mean it's like with all trees and bushes and
A,Oh ya
B,Uhm
A,So
B,Uhm uhm
A,So what have you been doing besides work
B,Well uh guess what
B,For the weekend I spent the entire weekend sorting photographs
A,Oh for me to see
B,Ya sort of uhm I'll probably bring them in one day and trying to find one that has got a clear picture of the the the face of a girl I told you about
A,Oh
B,So that uh you'll probably be able to see it better
A,Uhm
B,Because the rest of it are pretty blur
A,Oh how come
B,Ya uhm guess not well taken and I don't have too many of it
A,Oh
B,I only have like uh maybe one or two clear ones
A,Okay so <unclear> word </unclear> so should I expect you to carry in a big note
B,Oh no no no
B,I'm just going to bring maybe one
A,Only one nuh
A,I thought you'll show us your album
B,Oh ya I can
A,<unclear> word </unclear>
B,I can but not I mean the rest will not be on her though
B,The rest will be like uh very scenery sort of un you know crazy things that I did
A,Oh but I want baby <unclear> word </unclear> too
B,Oh well I don't have any
A,You don't have any
B,Right
A,Not even one
B,No the oldest or rather the youngest I have is six
B,So if you consider that as a baby
A,Well never mind that will do
A,I can imagine
A,My little exhibit
B,Ya right
B,Oh
B,Okay someday I'll bring it
A,When will you be coming down again
B,Uhm don't know
B,Not at this point
B,I guess maybe when I start working at NUH again
A,Oh
A,Will it take long
B,Hopefully in the next two weeks
A,Oh that depends on how fast you finish your analysis is it
B,Uhm uhm
A,I see
B,Or rather depends on Prof Ong
A,Oh when when he decides to have space for you
B,Uhm uhm ya
A,At first recently they've been having a lot of short courses and speakers from <unclear> word </unclear> and all that
B,Uhm uhm
A,<unclear> word </unclear> uh he's always showing people around
B,Uhm oh
A,And and Dr Ng has been using the room quite frequently
B,Uhm uhm
A,So even if you come I think you'll be slightly disturbed by him
B,Oh oh
A,There's this group of students coming in and <unclear> word </unclear>
B,But I guess I won't be using much of that room because uh since this is going to be at the workplace you know the workstation of whoever is going to participate
A,Uhm
B,Then so it looks like most of the time except for the uhm calibration which can be done not necessary in that room
A,Uh huh
B,It can be done outside too
A,Oh
B,And the rest of it uhm who will done at the subjects' uh work workstation
A,And so you'll be running around carrying all your equipment and all that
B,Uhm ya maybe or rather the subject will be running around
B,Ya with the electrodes on
A,I see oh but do you have to bring a new brief case of electrodes and stuff like that
B,Uhm you mean over to NUH from here
A,Uhm no to your subjects
B,Uh no no no
B,They'll be in other words uhm after they finish up their calibration which you know I could always do it outside
A,Uh
B,uhm near where you work
A,Uh huh
B,Then uhm after that she's free to move about and this time it'll be quite different in the sense that she won't have those uhm like the angle equipments attached so she'll only have like uh six electrodes attached to her and that's it
A,Ya
B,So probably will be <unclear> word </unclear> on made easier for her to move around
A,Uh huh
B,Ya
A,<unclear> word </unclear> computer to monitor her movement and all that
B,Oh
A,She has to cart that around you see
B,Ya but that would be placed at the workstation
A,Oh
B,At uh huh you know where wherever she works
A,Get them to provide you with the laptop
B,Ya that was what I was thinking
B,Maybe you could borrow one from your department
A,*laughs*
B,Uhm uhm
A,Ya it'll be a lot more convenient than carting one <unclear> word </unclear>
B,Ya in fact the spot I used when I was in nuh HP
A,Oh that's because Alex is there and then
B,Uhm uhm
A,<unclear> word </unclear> give you laptops and all that <unclear> word </unclear>
B,Uhm uhm ya
A,<unclear> word </unclear> probably a personal laptop
A,Well you can ask you can borrow from Dr Tee
A,He's got a new one and he's quite happy with it
B,Oh dear
A,well it's a Macintosh
B,Uh huh
A,<unclear> word </unclear>
B,Oh he has got every all the new facilities
A,Ya it's like he's so augh I can't stand him
B,Well does he still play that games and make those noise
A,Uuh
B,The singing and
A,Occasionally hoping that you're not around
B,Oh uhm
B,Good after-work entertainment
A,Ya
B,And he finally finished his notes so he can take a breather for a while but Hadiah says she's chasing him
B,What notes
A,Uhm for the short course
A,He helps out in the short course his lectures and all that
B,Hah
B,Uh huh
A,So he has to produce a set of notes
B,Uhm uhm
A,So Hadiah has to chase him each time for the notes because it's late
B,Oh boy
B,He probably has too much to say
A,But I mean he actually he's involved in so many things
A,He's got so many projects running at same time
B,Ah
A,and and he's also got a uhm poly student attached to him
B,Uh huh
A,For I don't know what they are doing but at the moment the poly student is doing a lot of calculations
B,Uhm
A,On molarity
B,Oh
B,Well in a way it's good
B,It keeps you really you know involved
A,Uhm
B,Otherwise well make good use of his brain
A,I asked him how come he took so many things
A,Then he said oh he just want to test his limits
A,See how far he can stretch
B,He
B,Ya
B,Precisely
B,After all he's talented so uh gifted so so you know got to squeeze every bit out of him
A,Ya I guess it's alright for him because he's still single and all and all that
B,Uhm
A,If he has a family it can be quite <unclear> word </unclear>
B,Uhm uhm yep and besides uh well he's young and energetic so
A,Uh
B,Uhm but now that he has got a new companion
A,Ya the cassette I don't know how it is
A,I must go and ask him what happen <unclear> word </unclear>
A,I haven't seen him the whole day today
B,Uhm uhm
A,Oh do you know that uh Bee Lan has given birth
B,Who
B,Oh oh
A,Bee Lan

A,Wrong Bee Lan
A,The other Bee Lan <unclear> word </unclear>
B,Uh
B,Oh I see
B,So is it a girl or boy
A,A little boy uh
B,Uhm
A,And then the baby was two weeks overdue uh I think
B,Oh uhm uhm
A,But I think it's uhm they induced the birth
B,Uh huh
A,So it's quite okay
A,In fact she had contractions but then the baby didn't come out
B,Uhm uhm
A,So she came back to work again
B,Oh
A,for a couple of more days
A,Then she was <unclear> word </unclear> admitted again on Saturday so on Sunday they induced the birth
B,Uhm uhm is that her first baby
A,No her third child
B,Whoa
A,She's already got one girl and one boy
B,Uh huh oh
A,So uhm there's about eight of us sharing to buy presents for her
B,Oh
A,And among them is Prof Ong Dr Hee and Dr David Koh
B,Oh oh
A,So I told Lay Har to charge them double <unclear> word </unclear> <X>
B,Good idea yep Uhm
A,Uhm don't know Anyway Lay Har is <unclear> word </unclear> responsible for buying all the baby things uh probably she get milk powder and diapers
B,Uhm uhm Uhm she's really experienced
A,Ya because for us it's like we didn't know what to get At first we thought we just uh combine and get some milk contribute some cash to give it to her
B,Uhm uhm
A,But not very nice
B,Uhm uhm yep
A,So we nominated Lay Har </X> </I>
