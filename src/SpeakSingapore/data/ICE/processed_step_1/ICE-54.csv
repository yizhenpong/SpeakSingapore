A,It's very practical
B,But I think we we don't yet slowly lah
B,We get the more essential things first
A,Fridge is it
B,Fridge
A,Fridge is important
A,We can store things inside
B,Ya but
A,Like you put your fruits you bring from home
A,You put your fruits

B,One desk
A,Then chair
B,What chair
A,Chair
A,We don't need a chair

A,All three of ours three of us should get the same chairs and tables
A,Of course he will have this big chair
A,If he wants to get another table he should get a bigger one for himself
A,At least both of us share the kind of table
A,Then there won't be some kind of discrepancy
A,This one will be for this computer like when you are not at your desk working you want to go to the computer you move the computer
A,Okay so we need another desk we need

A,What I mean files on the table
B,Oh files on the table <unclear> word </unclear>
A,I think we should get those types of shelf
B,Shelves ah
A,We should
A,We can maximise space that way you know
A,Think that shelf you can you put a few file
A,Then put one on top there so it looks really it looks like it's part of the desk
B,That looks like your bedroom
A,No you can
A,I don't know whether he'll allow if we put shelves
A,Shelves maximise space
B,But for us it's very unoffice like you know
A,Really
A,If we can make it very cosy
A,When do we have to be office like
B,Ya
A,What's more
A,We're advertising agency you know
