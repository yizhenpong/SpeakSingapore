A,Oh yes I like stones

A,Oh I see
C,You know It had the Luciano Soprada logo in gold you know

C,Ya quite cheap
A,Quite varied
C,I mean even though they were they were selling things for forty percent to seventy percent it was still too out of out of like what
A,above five hundred
C,No I mean like blouses two hundred and fifty dollars for just a blouse
A,It's terrible
C,I mean you won't want to pay two hundred and fifty for one blouse
A,in the normal way

A,One suit or one Haven't got anything that's above two hundred yet
C,Yet
A,Mhm </X> </I>
