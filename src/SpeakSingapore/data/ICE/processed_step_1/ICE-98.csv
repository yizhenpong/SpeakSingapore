A,Hello
B,Hi
B,Are you asleep yet
A,Hi
A,Naw
A,Going to
A,A little bit more I would have knocked off
B,Okay
B,Are you
A,I can
B,Is she being recorded now
B,Okay ya you're being recorded already
A,Whoa being recorded uh
A,Okay
B,Ya okay
B,So you have to start telling me all about what you've been doing during your holidays
A,Oh ya I've got to start telling you what I've been doing during this holidays
A,Uh not very many days are there
A,<O> Sighs </O>
B,No you mean when Kim Tok went away uh uh holidays began already what
A,Kim Tok went away on Saturday night
B,Ya ya
B,So they were on holiday already right
A,Oh yes
A,Ya actually they were on holiday
A,So far actually what what did we do to them uh
B,But did he take leave
A,No he didn't
B,Oh I see
A,But what he did was that you know he stayed back in the morning like worked here two hours while I went to do my driving
A,I told you I took my test failed you know
B,Ya that's right that's right
A,So the last week everyday I was out on the road
B,Oh I see I see
B,So you mean you had like intensive training during the
A,Ya I had I had a full four days or five days prior to that lah
B,Oh
A,And then there were no baby-sitters because all the all the Navigators staff girls were in camps in church camps and the Navigators camp and Teen NavTeens camp you know
A,<unclear> word </unclear> camps you know
B,Oh oh ya that's right
A,So I told him please lah just stay back and nuh just keep an eye on the kids and work here
B,Ya that's right ya
A,Actually they're alright you know
B,Ah
A,Just need somebody to keep an eye you see
B,That's right
A,So he worked here and then he went to the office
A,So let's see uh
A,But he took one morning off to bring them to the beach uh to catch crabs uh
B,Oh ya lah that's right
A,Ya
B,So but then before that how did you do your driving
A,Oh I've <unclear> word </unclear> twice a week only you know
B,Oh then how did you do it
B,When uhm
A,Oh <unclear> word </unclear> Benjamin is in school
B,Oh I see I see uh
A,Ya
B,So you had to arrange it lah
A,Ya so I don't have to arrange it because Benjamin goes to school so I timed it such that uh I will come back in time to make lunch for him you see
B,Ya
A,He comes back by twelve
B,So that means the instructor will come and pick you uh
A,No no no I go to the driving school to uh I <unclear> word </unclear> driving from driving school
B,Oh I see and then they'll take you on the course
A,Ah then they take me on the course lah
B,Oh I see
A,Ah then it's a one-hour forty minutes deal
B,Uhm
A,So hundred minutes so I'll take a bus to the driving school that's about twenty twenty-five minutes and then uh
B,Where is that
A,Bukit Batok you know near Julie's house
B,Oh so it's alright lah ya
A,Very near
B,Uhm uhm
A,So I'll come back
A,By the time when I come back it's time to get lunch ready and then Benjamin will be home lah
A,That is the reason
B,Oh I see but it it costs a lot nuh
A,Huh
A,Cost a lot uh
B,Does it
B,Ya I'm sure
A,Ah ya anyway
B,Ya that's right because like now the whole thing I think you know it's so costly
A,Thousand over you know
B,Ya
A,Thousand over
B,So if you have to take it again
A,No need lah
A,Actually see the school is uh one thing that's good about them uh
B,Uhm
A,What they do is that they bring you uh for the circuit and then uh it's about how many lessons uh
A,I was I was a bit slow lah
B,Uhm Uhm
A,you know I think the younger drivers they learn it for about half far far faster than me
B,Oh I see
B,So you mean it's all in whether you take it again or not and all that
A,No actually it's up to me
B,the base cost is the same
A,Uh no no it's up to me you see
B,Uhm uhm
A,For example I took about thirty two lessons with them you know
B,Uhm uhm uhm
A,So but out of thirty two lessons uh fourteen lessons uh
B,Uhm
A,Uh fourteen or sixteen I think half of it or more than half were on the circuit you know
B,Oh I see
A,That means they teach you do all those parking lah all those <unclear> word </unclear>
B,Ya which is the essential lah
A,Ah Uh huh
B,Ya
A,And then uhm the second uh half of it nuh was on the road
B,Oh I see
A,So after that you see at the at different stages they pass you you know
B,Uhm uhm uhm
A,You must pass the fourth stage uh
B,Uhm
A,Must get less than thirty points before they allow you to go to the fifth stage you see
B,Oh I see
A,Then when you finish the fifth stage uh you're supposed to get less than twenty points before they allow you to sit for the test you know
B,So you never had to go on the road lah
A,No I went on the road
B,Oh you did
A,I did you know
B,So that means you did pass all the stages
A,I passed all the stages
B,Aiyoh
A,So right now uh when I sat for the exams uh
B,Ah ah
A,they thought that I should be able to make it lah Fifty percent lah
B,Ah ah ah ah
A,you know as good as that
B,I see I see
A,So now that I fail
B,Ah
A,I can just go back to school and take one lesson you see
B,Oh
A,Just the minimum of one only
B,I see I see No but what I mean is that when you go through the test suh
A,Uh huh
B,you have to start all over again
A,Yes yes
B,Oh I see
B,No lah but I think you shouldn't take just one you should take more than one because it's a matter of practice
A,But you know it's so costly you know
B,I know but then the thing is that driving is practice you see
A,Just more time uh
B,Ya it's just practice it's not because you see even if you pass uh by chance uh
A,Uh huh
B,then after that you're not that confident driving on the road too you you still it's a matter of practice
A,It's true you know
B,Ya so that's why actually you might as well put in that effort and then get it through you know
A,Ya
B,rather than because if you keep delaying it also
A,That's true
B,Ya because when can you take the next test
A,August
A,My next test is in August
B,Oh so between then and now I mean you you need at least to drive a couple of times a month
A,I do need uh
B,Ya
A,I do need So what I was planning to do lah I thought what I'll do is that since I have learnt the basic skills from them uh
B,Uhm uhm
A,I use the same skills and go to a private one that's half the cost you see
B,Ya ya I see
A,You know that means what I need is I I just need confidence on the road
B,Yes yes that's right that's right
A,You know the circuit is no problem
B,Ah ya
A,I didn't even get a single point in the circuit
B,Ya
A,you know I mean I it was okay you see
B,Ya ya that's right
A,Parking was no problem even
B,Ya
A,So I just need that confidence uh half hour
B,Oh you mean this one you go the one you go to is actually ran by the government
B,It's not a private one
A,It's a private one you know
B,Oh same lah
A,But it's a big private company
B,Oh I see
A,but uh they don't allow you to take more than two times a week you know
B,Oh
A,So when you book with them uh you only got maximum of two times a week to take you know
B,Oh I see
B,So the private one it means it's cheaper is it
A,Uh the the private one is cheaper
A,Private means individuals lah
A,I mean those uh you know that you used to learn from you see
B,Ah ya lah that's right
A,whereas the school lah they already had a system lah
A,You know they have already worked a system as to how
B,Ya
A,you should drive how <unclear> word </unclear> you should see it
B,Oh ya
A,what you should notice lah
A,I mean they almost like basically train and instruct you
B,Ya it's quite professional lah
A,Ya quite professional you see
B,Uhm uhm uhm
A,But I think one of the disadvantage I find when I
B,Uhm
A,I took a private one for about four times lah
B,Ya
A,Just to ride drive you know and see what's the difference you know
B,Uhm
A,I think in terms of uh skills and technicalities uh
B,Uhm
A,the school is superb lah
B,Ya that's right
A,They're they're really superb on that
B,Ya uhm
A,But the problem is because they're so trained to teach you they don't give you a chance uh to think you know
B,Uhm uhm
A,to decide for yourself you see
B,Ya that's right
A,So when I drove on the road with this uh private one
B,Uhm
A,it was very good
A,I mean I I I applied what I learnt
B,Uhm
A,he didn't say anything he just let me drive
B,Uhm
A,In fact they were so confident I'll pass
A,All of them
A,I think God just doesn't want me to kill anybody on the road or just kill myself kill my children whatever
B,Ya
A,You know
B,No I think it's basically
A,Uhm ya
B,Just more practice
B,That kind of thing and you have I mean the confidence is also gained through driving it often enough
A,That's right lah
B,Ya
A,I don't think I've got it often enough
B,That's right
B,So you probably just go to the private one and get it you know a couple of times a week
A,Ah <unclear> word </unclear> so I've to
B,just to keep up the momentum
A,Ah I mean it's far cheaper anyway
A,I mean it's about uh well how much
A,Twenty over dollars uh twenty over for uh one and a half hour session you see whereas the school is about forty eight you know That's over twice
B,Ya terrible uh
B,When I was learning it I was like paying the most expensive school lah
B,Lambert's last time uh <unclear> word </unclear>
A,Oh Lambert's uh
A,How much was it
B,Ya eight fifty
A,Ya I know
B,Per hour that kind of thing
A,In fact somebody was telling they only learned it for five dollars you know
B,Ya but that was ages ago lah
A,Ya
B,Probably Kim Tok's was free
A,Free ya because he told me how did he learn driving
B,Uhm
A,<unclear> word </unclear> Malaysia I think
A,What he did was that
B,Uh
A,he drove around you see
B,Ya that's right
A,So came back here he took a a driving licence and passed you know
B,Ya ya that's right because he's confident on the road you see
B,That's why I remember some people who ride motorbikes and all uh
A,Uh
B,after they uhm you know they want to go to get their licence uh
A,Ya
B,they they learn it very fast because you kind of have a bit more road-sense already
A,Oh
B,Ya that's why
A,So I think I'll I'll press on uh because I don't think I want to give up
A,the only thing is that whoa
B,Ya no you shouldn't
B,I mean after that all that money you spent on it already
A,No thousand over dollars now you know
B,Ya that's right ya
B,So <X>
A,<unclear> word </unclear>
B,It's a matter of just you know keeping it up
A,<unclear> word </unclear>
B,It's only a pp uh that you know private cars you can't drive Huh otherwise it's you know it's a matter of practicing that's all
A,It's true you know
B,Ya
A,It's true
B,Ya
A,But anyway I anyway that morning when I was doing my quiet time uh <unclear> word </unclear>
B,Uhm
A,I mean the Lord gave a verse of Psalms Forty Two <&>  42 </&> says 'By day He will direct His love at night He He gives me a song'
B,Uhm
A,and I thought it was quite good because uh you know the the meaning of the the fact that He directed my His His love towards me uh
B,Uhm
A,by allowing me to fail was quite encouraging you know
B,Uhm
A,Then after I sent Kim Tok off to the airport it's so funny I was I didn't realize how tired I was I was so geared up for the whole week for this test suh
B,Ya
A,that suddenly when when uh I I went to the airport after the whole thing was over they told me I failed it was very nice you know
B,Uhm
A,this that this instructor was saying 'Oh no uh we regret we can't give you you know'
B,Uhm
A,This time I'm I'm sorry and I got thirty one
B,Uhm
A,I felt so relieved then but I went to the airport I was so tired and sleepy
B,Uhm
A,Sending him off I went to buy uh duck duck rice from the shop uh
B,Uh
A,Then this man gave me back my change you know Ten dollars
B,Uhm
A,give me four dollars and I was looking at the money I wasn't actually looking
B,Uhm
A,I was looking and not looking you see
B,Ya
A,And he thought that I was questioning his integrity He said 'Uh isn't it right Isn't it right ' I said 'No no no ya it's right I'm not looking at the money I'm not thinking I'm just tired you know' And then he told me say 'I teach you how to do some exercises These are Chinese martial art exercises' He <unclear> word </unclear>
B,Oh he really did uh
A,Yes he's so sweet you know He said some he gave me a name of the what He said 'I I practise this and it's very good you know Help to revitalize your your your zeng san uh
B,Uhm
A,they call zeng san you know
B,Ah ah ah
A,So I say 'Oh' So I told him 'No lah no lah Anyway
B,Uhm
A,I'm so tired because I just failed my driving test lah'
B,Uh
A,You know I just came and sent my husband off but I failed my driving test
B,Uh
A,So he says 'How many times already ' I said 'First time' 'Aiyah first time no problem Very few people pass first try'
B,Ya that's right I passed my fifth time okay
A,'A' but good lah you pressed on
B,Ya and then this Tun Tun passed first time because he quarelled with the instructor or rather after that he told the instructor 'Come on' He argued and then he got through because
A,<unclear> word </unclear>
B,you know last time it's not so scientific you know
A,Oh
B,it's not point system right
A,Oh ya ya ya
B,It's more a bit more judgemental So he argued argued argued and he came back he passed
A,No but now they're quite strict you know They're quite fierce about it you know
B,Ya that's right Now it's more scientific you see
A,Ya
B,So it's more difficult
A,In fact they don't put any ar arguments and things like that you know <unclear> word </unclear>
