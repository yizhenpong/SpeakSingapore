A,Number six Mr Das
B,Mr Chairman Sir I beg to move that the sum to be allocated for Head P to be reduced by ten dollars in respect of Code PE one five zero zero of the main estimates
B,Mr Chairman Sir I agree with the government's philosophy there is need for preventive measures to help one remain healthy and what better way to do this than to start at the school level
B,Sir I'd like to point out to this House that there are far few doctors uh looking after the school health service
B,I've been informed Sir that there are four doctors at the clinics and eleven doctors in the field taking care of four hundred and fifty thousand pupils in our three hundred and fifty primary secondary uh pre-university and junior colleges
B,These doctors are ably assisted by thirty staff nurses and eighteen assistant nurses
B,Sir only primary one and secondary four students are screened by doctors
B,The screening at primary six is done by nurses
B,Is this because of shortage of doctors
B,And what about the quality of screening for these children at primary six
B,Is the Ministry satisfied with this level of screening
B,Are other programs being sacrificed because of lack of doctors
B,Sir I would urge the minister to use his good offices to persuade the Finance minister not to apply the zero growth in the case of school health services
B,Sir I beg to move
A,Question is that the sum to be allocated for Head P be reduced by ten dollars in respect of Code PE fifteen hundred of the main estimates
A,Dr Wong
C,Mr Chairman uh I'm glad doc uhm Mr Chandra Das supports the Ministry's phil philosophy that prevention is better than cure and he also supports the objectives of our school health service
C,Uhm with regard to the number of doctors in the school health service actually it has increased from uh the number uh from ten in nineteen eighty eight uh to fourteen uh this year and that is in spite of our zero uh growth uh policy
C,Uh on the number of nurses in the school health service uh I think he's got the uh figure wrong
C,In fact uh we have now one hundred and four nurses in the whole school health service
C,Uh the entire staff complement is hundred and eighty six so so uh it is by no means uh small uh staff complement
C,and our expenditure has increased from five point four million in nineteen eighty eight to seven point three million
C,Now whether medical screening uh should be done by doctors all the time uh it is uh a matter of uh you know expert opinion also as a matter of the end result the outcome
C,It is true that uh medical screening carried out uh in uh primary one and uh secondary four are done by doctors while those uh at primary six are done by nurses
C,But our nurses are trained you see
C,So and and besides uh our children also get uh uh to have visual screening every year
C,They also get spinal screening you know intermittently so it is not just the medical screening at primary one primary six and secondary four
C,Now uh actually our children are very healthy and they are amongst the healthiest age group in our population
C,Uh if by the time they enter primary school uh if they get very uh any severe medical condition they would have been picked up by our uh medical services before they enter school
C,And even during the school years those requiring specialist attention would have been sent to specialist outpatient clinic in the Institute of Health
C,Uh and uh actually attendance uh attendance figures in our polyclinic show that the proportion of uh school children seeking medical treatment at polyclinics uh is much lower than the other age groups
C,So all indications are that the present kind of medical screening services we give at uh at in in our schools uh is adequate
C,It is better to utilise uh our scarce resources in other programs but of course I welcome uh his support uh uh uh you know for our program to be receiving more funds uh from the Ministry of Finance
C,But uh please rest assured uh uh in the opinion of medical uh experts I think our school health is doing a good job
A,Mr Chairman Sir since the Minister of State welcomes my suggestion I think the Ministry should work harder to get more staff
A,On that note Sir I beg leave to withdraw
A,Member given leave to withdraw
D,Ay Ay
A,Yes withdrawn Amendment number seven
A,Dr Michael Lim
E,Sir I beg to move that the sum to be allocated for Head P be reduced by ten dollars in respect of Code PE five one O O of the development estimates
E,Primary health care is currently considered a poor cousin of hospital services but I believe that it is as important if not more important as secondary and tertiary health care
E,A good primary health care service will result in early detection of diseases and prevention of complications
E,In developing new polyclinics we must not only continue to make it affordable but we must strive to improve the level of primary health care
E,I have uh certain proposals which I would like the minister to consider
E,One install X-ray facilities in all new polyclinics
E,The Ministry should consider installing X-ray facilities not only to improve the diagnostic capabilities but also by allowing general practitioners to use the X-ray facilities the level of primary health care in that area will be enhanced
E,Furthermore with a higher <unclear> word </unclear> it will result in more cost-effective use usage of the facilities
E,Number two set up rehabilitation facilities at all polyclinics
E,This will allow patients with stroke orthopaedic injuries and other physical disabilities to have easy access to such facilities
E,Otherwise the physical disabilities alone will discourage them from travelling to the hospitals for rehabilitation
E,Early rehabilitation will allow the patient to integrate back into society and will relieve the social burden of family members
E,Thirdly medication
E,Patients seen at hospitals are discharged at polyclinics for follow-up when they are stable
E,However in certain instances these drugs are not available at the polyclinics and there's no alternative drug within the same class of action available in the polyclinic
E,As a result CFC card holders do not want to be discharged from specialist clinics as they are unable to get the medication required
E,I propose that the Ministry allow polyclinic doctors to make an indent for non-standard drugs for CFC card holders who require medication currently not available in the polyclinic pharmacy
E,These requests should only be allowed if the patients are sent to the polyclinics from specialist in government and restructured hospitals
E,This will make it unnecessary for such patients to be seen at the specialist clinic and hospitals just for the sake of being able to obtain the required medication
E,Lastly I quality of medical care
E,At this point I would actually like to agree with Dr Tan Cheng Bock who said that there were certain problems about primary health care system
E,I think one of the weaknesses and a very important weakness of our current system in the polyclinics is a lack of continuity of medical care
E,Patients with chronic medical conditions like diabetes are often attended to by different doctors at different visits
E,At each visit the harassed doctor scours the medical notes and makes a hurried assessment as he has a large pool of patients waiting in line to see him
E,Fighting against the problems of unfamiliarity limited time and a large patient turnover he can only do his humanly best and will not be able to give optimal care
E,For the diabetic patient he can only try to adjust the medication to control the blood sugar level
E,There is no time to look for eye complications kidney complications vascular complications and there is definitely no time to give proper counselling
A,Dr Lim
E,How does the Ministry
A,Dr Lim
E,intend to improve the situation
E,I would like the minister's views on these points
A,Question is that the sum to be allocated for Head P be reduced by ten dollars in respect of Code P fifty one hundred of the development estimates
A,Dr Wong
C,Mr Chairman all our large polyclinics have laboratory on site
C,These are these laboratories are also opened to GPs to the general practitioners
C,However the general practitioners' utilization of our polyclinic laboratories has been poor comprising less than two percent of the laboratory workload
C,Now this is because some private labs are providing a special service to the GPs collecting specimens from them at no additional charge
C,and so GPs find it not necessary to send the patients to the polyclinic uh lab
C,Now currently only one polyclinic at Tampines has an X-ray service which is also opened to GPs but again its utilization by GPs is very low comprising less than five percent of the X-rays uh taken
C,Now uh patients who who are discharged from government uh or restructured hospitals uh the CSC card holders or other people can obtain nonstandard drugs at the polyclinics if they are patients of the polyclinics
C,So the idea is that they should be followed up on their polyclinic
C,and if the use of non-standard drugs is warranted then uh an application would be made for the drug to be supplied to polyclinics
C,and at uh uh at the usual cost of one dollar per item up to a maximum of four uh per uh uh per
C,Uh now uh the lack of continuous care I think uh we have covered this subject quite well when I responded to Dr Tan Cheng Bock's uh uh proposal about uh community health care system
C,Thank you
A,Dr Lim
E,Sir just one last point
E,The reason why your lab facilities are not well utilized is not just the convenience but the cost as well
E,In fact it is more costly to do a lab test in the polyclinic than at a private uh lab
C,Is that so I would look into it
E,Sir uh I thank the Minister for her reply and I beg leave to withdraw my uh amendment
A,Is member given leave to withdraw his amendment
D,Ay
A,Amendment is withdrawn
F,Sir Doc Dr Tan has given us a very long discourse yesterday on primary health care
F,I'd urge him to please pay more attention to what we are doing so that he he can better understand the whole philosophy because what
A,Order
F,let me let me finish
F,Sit down please
G,Mr Speaker Sir
A,Minister is not giving way
F,Sir he's taken a lot a lot of time yesterday more time than he should have
G,No I think
F,But so
F,Sit down first come on
A,Order order
A,Dr Tan resume your seat
G,He has spent a lot of time making mini ministerial statements
A,Doc Dr Tan resume your seat please
F,Because all that he described is preci are precisely things that we are already doing just that he's managed to call them under different name
F,He's quoted the Finnish model saying that we are under-spending without realizing from the data that actually we're spending more than what Finland is spending on primary health care
F,Sir Mr Loh was correct
F,Primary health care I think we are very well-established but nonetheless I appreciate his concerns
F,and I can assure him that in our future studies and planning for the primary health care I will definitely like to call on him to volunteer his time in helping us to further improve primary health care
F,Sir in terms of hospital services I can assure him that we are we also share his concerns in terms of ensuring that we do not over-provide medical services in hospital area
F,and that's why we've been freezing the number of beds for many many years <X>
