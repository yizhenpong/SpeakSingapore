A,Witness
A,You mentioned one employee by the name of Ernest
A,Do you know his full name
B,I think it is Ernest d'Souza
B,He's a Eurasian
A,Ernest d' Souza
B,Yes
A,What was his occupation in nineteen eighty five at around the time when the Plaintiff met the accident
A,What was his designation
B,Production assistant
A,You were then the production supervisor
B,Yes
B,At the time of the accident
A,What was the nature of the relationship between you and Ernest
A,I mean I am not talking about your private relationship
A,What I mean is as employer in your employment
A,What was who is answerable to whom and how was the relationship like
B,At that time in eighty four eighty five uh we still got a problem of recruitment at that time
A,Slowly please
A,Let his Honour take down
A,Yes you had problem of recruitment
B,Yes and the person on top of me is a Japanese
B,He's a production manager Mister Naiya
B,So after that uh there is a vacancy for assistant manager but it's not filled up
B,And there's a vacancy for senior supervisor it's not filled up and the next one is supervisor
B,I am the supervisor at that time and below me there should be group leaders for every section
B,There are five or six sections under me
B,If everything is smoothly each individual group uh will have a group leader
B,But sometimes we have the people there but we don't got the people of calibre so it's uh not filled up
B,And after this group leader there's a the step lower
A,So in eighty five there was no group leader
B,There's no group leader
B,In fact further down is assistant group leader
B,We also don't have assistant group leader
A,What was the nature of the work of this group leader
B,No no
B,It is basically the same and after this group leader is production assistant
A,Production assistant
A,Was this Ernest as you were saying
B,Yes yes so
A,And below that
B,Below that it will be workers
B,So my policy at that time is if you my policy at that time is
B,It is not uh my policy
B,In fact it is the company policy
B,If you come in without any primary education you join as a worker
B,If you got O level you join in as P A
B,So from there we assess you and we try to promote you
B,And I would like to tell you that Ernest was one of the more bright one
B,Even if if he never resign today maybe he might be assistant supervisor
B,And in fact he never resigned
B,In fact I sacked him because of he absent for two weeks
A,Correct that is besides the point
A,Now what I'm asking you is Ernest placed in charge of one section alone or what is the relationship to you
A,The relationship vis-a-vis you and Ernest in the job in this colour section
B,Yes everything he have to report to me because at that time I was training him to be the assistant group leader
A,So normally in the production side where these plates are being removed there would have been a ring leader as you call it or leader group leader as you call it
A,Supervising this assistant supervisor or whoever you said is it
A,Is there one position for group leader
A,Normally what would be who would be supervising this group leader this assistant production
B,Myself is the supervisor
A,I see
A,And if there is a group leader what duty is his
B,Basically what he do is he will do the same thing like the production assistant only the title only meaning the title
B,Example let's say Ernest is the group leader and if I take another newcomer he got O level so he is also a production assistant
B,So the only thing is the seniority problem
A,At that time how many assistant supervisors did the company have
B,There is no assistant supervisor
A,No no in the position as Ernest
A,Ernest was assistant
B,He was a P A production assistant
A,Production assistant
A,How many of such persons were employed
B,He is the only one
A,He is the only one
B,Yes and plus the Q C
B,Q C
B,There is two for Q C
A,Q C
B,Two production assistant for Q C
A,That is a different section
B,Ya but it is under me
B,Ya
A,So in this section of colour matching where these moulds these plates are being taken
A,Was this Ernest the only person who was in charge of both these machines
B,Yes
A,And where were you stationed normally
A,What was does your duty require you to be around this machine as it's functioning or
B,Not necessary because my office is on the second floor it's on the second floor and this machine is in the production floor
B,So I have to walk quite a distance and the nature of the work is that every morning every morning he is briefed what he have to do
B,What I want him to do
A,Ernest's been briefed
B,Yah he's being briefed
B,So he have to do what he's told
A,And Ernest gets the workers to do the work is it
B,Basically he do it himself
B,At that time he was alone I think
A,And you see the Plaintiff says at the time of the accident he was already into the job of removing plates
B,Yes
A,This was done with your knowledge wasn't it
B,Yes
A,You knew that he was doing that job
B,Yes
B,But I transfer him out in August
B,Somewhere in August
A,August nineteen eighty five
B,Nineteen eighty five
A,Out from where
B,From Q C
A,No no I'm now referring to the section to the time he was already in the colour matching section
A,Now witness so who then if he has any complaints or anything
A,Who does he refer to Ernest
B,Either one
B,He can refer to Ernest he can refer to me
A,And normally who gives the orders to the Plaintiff
B,Because he's quite new in the section so normally I go through Ernest
A,You go through Ernest
B,Yes yes because if I go through him I am bypassing Ernest
A,And in between this production of this colour plates
A,Would Ernest be required to show the sample as and when they produce times the sample of the plate to you to confirm whether they can proceed with the production
B,Yes
A,And on the day of the accident the Plaintiff says that it was while Ernest was going upstairs to the office to show either you or somebody else
A,I'm not sure the plate that he was told to carry on and he did
A,So could you remember Ernest coming to you with the plate
B,Well anyway I don't see him
A,You didn't see him
B,Yes
A,You didn't see Ernest
B,At that time I believe it is only a few minutes difference
B,The time of accident is two o'clock
B,So normally my lunch break is twelve forty to one twenty
B,At one twenty the siren will go on and during this lunch break most of the worker will be sleeping or resting
B,So I don't see them starting to work at about one forty five because they will take their time to wash their face go to the loo you know
A,So on that day of the incident you don't remember Ernest coming to see you with the plate
B,No no
A,And at the time of the accident
A,Now the Plaintiff says the accident was at one forty five and this was not disputed
A,You were not at the scene of the accident
B,No
A,Now witness
A,Since you know much about this machine
A,Can you confirm that the machine as it works in the normal sense when the gate guard remains open the mould the moving mould should remain stationary
B,Yes
A,And do you agree with me also if at all the moving mould has moved there must be something faulty about the machine
B,I don't think when the gate is open the mould can move
B,Not to my knowledge
A,So from your opinion in normal conditions the mould should not move
B,Yes
A,Now witness
A,What is the function of the two switches one at the rear and one in the front
A,What is the function of the switches
B,We call it a something like a relay switch
B,So the function is to cut off the front one
B,If the gate get contact with the front one that means the circuit is on
B,So if you finish your process you open the door and the back touch the switch on the back the circuit should be cut off
A,Correct
A,So as one opens the guard gate it should establish contact with the rear switch and then the circuit should be cut off and the mould should be stationary
B,Yes
A,Now witness
A,You said that after the accident people like Ernest refused to touch the machine
A,Ernest in your own words was an experienced worker
B,Yes
A,How long has he been working with that company before that
B,Maybe two years
A,Did you not tell him why is he refusing to work
B,Because the reason I
B,Of course everybody feel very upset about the accident and I wouldn't want to you know to question him why he don't want to use
B,It might be due to you know all the skin and the flesh are stick on the mould
B,You have to consider that
B,When the hand was crushed all the skin and some of the bones got stuck on the mould and nobody want to clean it
A,Witness please
A,You see your evidence before the Court was that nobody wanted to work on that machine
A,And then to relay their fear or something like that you had to call this engineer from this Miki company
A,Now what I'm asking you is this
B,But I never asked him what fear he had
A,I see
A,You didn't ask him
B,Yes
B,So as a supervisor I presume that my assessment is that maybe because of the bones and the skin got stuck there
A,No no
A,We're not asking for your presumption
A,We're asking you what you know
A,Now witness the inspector from the Ministry of Labour Mister Lawrence Chew who gave evidence earlier said that he was told by Mister Tan Boon Keng
A,This Mister Tan Boon Keng was he the assistant production manager then
B,At that time yes
A,And you were
A,He was higher in office than yourself
B,He's more superior than me
A,He was more superior than you
A,And he was the officer who was present at the time the officers from the Ministry of Labour came to inspect the machine
B,Yes because at that time I was not available
A,Witness
A,You said later on the engineer recommended that two more switches
B,Not two
B,One
A,One switch
A,One more switch be put on the Miki machine
B,Yes
B,On the front side
A,On the front side
A,Did you all put that switch
B,Yes
A,When was this switch installed
B,A few months later
A,Few months later
B,Yes
A,Was it recommended for safety reasons to ensure that the guard doesn't close
B,No the guard will close
B,So why this Japanese engineer recommend
B,I'm not very sure why he recommend the additional switch on the front side
A,You are not sure why
B,I'm not sure
A,This Mister Tan Boon Keng
A,Where is he now
A,Is he employed with the company
B,No he already left two years ago
B,Sorry three years ago
A,Do you know where he is now
B,He is in Singapore
A,You know his whereabouts
B,Roughly yes
A,You know
A,Where do you think he's residing
B,Somewhere near my place
A,Somewhere near your place
A,That would be
A,That would be what address you know
B,Maybe
B,I don't know the address but somewhere in Bukit Batok
A,But you know his address you would be able to get that
B,No no
B,I call him
A,You know his telephone number
B,Yes
A,What is his telephone number sorry </I>
