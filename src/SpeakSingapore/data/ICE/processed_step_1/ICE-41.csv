A,Don't say always leh
A,hasn't happen yet

B,I don't need to see other people
A,Well said man you
A,Should I say the same thing
A,You like your milk tea
B,Oh I love it
A,That's good
A,We were talking about Felicity right
B,Uhm
A,Ya it was such a letdown towards the end
A,Of course they won't want to tell us who she went off with
B,Ya you know these Hollywood they want to you know bring it to a climax to a point where you need to watch the next season to find out
B,Like Friends right
A,Uhm
B,Every season they end with Ross and Rachel going to come together
B,But you don't know whether they come together
A,What they call a cliffhanger
B,Ya they always do that
A,So
B,But I found one thing very interesting
B,Don't know whether whether you noticed when you were watching
B,Throughout the whole the whole the whole whole show the show uses a piece of music classical music
A,Oh yes
A,That's the one you lent me
A,What is it called
B,It's called Bolero by Ravel
A,Ya that's right I remember
A,It starts with one instrument and then it goes on to have more and more instruments
A,Yes
B,That's right
B,And everything reaches a climax to the end
A,Yes
B,So it's interesting that they use this music
B,And you find the music each sequence getting louder and louder
B,You know you are going to reach a climax
B,But the sad thing is that the climax is the next season
A,But half way through the they changed music
A,It's no longer that Ravel music
B,Oh
A,Ya they changed it half way through
B,Well I have not finished watching it
A,It's quite good uh the suspense
B,Ya
A,The way they build up
A,I think it's coming true
A,People are coming in
B,Ya you see
A,They are at Cool Station
B,I told you it will happen
B,But like I said one more time
B,The world the world is in front of me
A,Thank you
A,You were saying you like Mad About You the recent episode
B,Ya
B,That was nice right
A,It's nice
A,It was very heartwarming I would say
B,You know my tears just rolled down when at the moment when they broke off and you wonder why for all the small reasons I mean he when they break up all the couples in the world would have broken up so many times over again
A,I like the way it's told
A,You have the daughter you know narrating and then it flashes back to how they were trying to come together
B,Cute and the daughter it's cute uh
A,Ya quite cute
B,Very cute the way she talks
A,What's the girl's name again uh
B,Mabel
A,Helen Hunt
A,No her screen name
A,So it's Paul and Jamie Bucman
B,Ya
A,I saw that part where they were at the altar and Jamie asked herself
A,She said no I cannot do this and then she left the altar
B,Ya
B,I saw that part too
A,Saw that part uh
A,But why
B,Why why do you think
B,I mean you you are a lady what intuitive thing can you think of
A,I don't know maybe she thought that after all they have been together for so long they brought up this girl so what so why is there a need to come together
B,Ya
B,I was thinking also maybe maybe maybe she is just sentimental of old things
B,So to do something new again maybe she scared that may change certain things or something like that
B,Maybe she didn't want to do it
B,What's the point of doing it
B,Maybe she just needed Paul to say yes I will marry you and to say I do first
B,That's all she needed
A,Uhm
B,Maybe that's all she need
A,Ya
B,But I just find it sad they broke off for those reasons
A,What are those reasons
A,I can't quite recall
B,Paul said that he couldn't stand her criticisms anymore to a point where she always he always feels that she is always right and he has to be the wrong one all the time
B,And he left because he couldn't couldn't stand it
A,How did did they came back together
A,Right that's why it's so heartwarming
B,Yes ya ya
A,Let's refresh how did they come back together again
B,They went to the premiere of their daughter's movie
B,The daughter their daughter made a movie
B,Sort of a sort of about their lives
A,So it is a movie that makes them come back together
B,I think is much more than that
B,But I think that's the catalyst ya
B,But all along I think even when they are off each other they still love each other a lot
A,Ya that's nice
A,I love the screen chemistry the chemistry between them Paul and Jamie
A,It's really good
B,Incidentally she is nominated again this year for the Emmy award for best actress
B,She won two years running already
A,She just got married isn't it
B,Ya
B,You know to who
A,Helen Hunt ya
A,Azaria
B,Ya
B,The guy is in Mad About You the dog trainer
A,The dog trainer
B,you know the dog trainer
A,How about Friends last night
A,What do you think of it
A,Did you watch
B,I watch but on and off
A,Uhm
B,So don't really have an impression
B,What do you think
A,Wait wait wait what was happening last night uh
B,They have a ball game
A,Oh they quite silly right
A,They wanted to throw
A,At first it was only Joey and uh
B,Ross
A,Ross
A,They wanted to keep it up for about two hours
A,And then Monica came in and join them
A,And then they went on for up to four hours
B,Ya
B,I mean kind of silly
B,Funny in a sense
B,Then Rachel came back with that cat that looks like a monster
A,Ya and Joey kept saying that's not a cat
A,That was quite cute
A,That was quite cute
A,So it was about the cat that doesn't look like a cat on a red pillow red cushion
B,When you you watched Austin Powers
A,Oh yes
B,The cat looks exactly like that Austin Powers cat
B,The evil
A,Oh the evil
B,Doctor Evil
A,Doctor Evil's cat
A,Ya I didn't notice that
A,And she tried to sell it off
A,She bought it for one thousand dollars
B,And she sold it at a profit
A,She sold it for
B,Thousand five
A,Thousand five
A,Not bad uh
B,Because the guy had a had a crush on her
A,Uhm
A,So wanted to please her
A,Tonight Ally McBeal
B,Ya
A,Do you think it would be a good season this time
B,Is is actually a repeat
A,Repeat of what
B,Of all the interesting episodes of the two seasons
B,So TCS just take out the interesting bits from all
B,They chose fourteen episodes
A,But they say it's the first of the
B,the first season
A,The first season
A,Oh I see
A,Oh ya this this movie called A Man Called Hero
A,They said it's terrible
B,What kind of terrible things you hear
A,Oh like what you told me the other day
A,How come he can just jump and reach the moon so incredible
A,And uh actually for Chinese movies we want to look for good sword fights and kung fu and things like that you know
A,But even my Malay students they said that it's terrible
B,Malay students
A,Malay students
A,What do you think
B,I think well it is the same team who did the Stormriders
B,And the guy said he wanted to do it better
B,So I think he I think I misunderstand the word better
A,Better means reach the moon
B,Ya ya ya
B,So you must jump higher you know
B,The kung fu must be more outrageous it's terrible right
B,Still still in the good old days they made a TV serial out of it
B,And that one is very good
B,The series was very long about thirty or forty episodes
B,I remember it was one of the best series around
A,Zhong Hua Ying Xiong
B,Zhong Hua Ying Xiong
B,It's not easy for them to condense three hundred copies of comic books stories into a two hour movie
B,They have to take out all the best bits of the comic book and put it into the movie
B,Guess it's a bit difficult too
A,Sounds like you are defending them
B,Well I have not watch it yet
B,But I think I will probably won't like it
A,Well I think this thing about special effects
A,Sometimes it makes it thin in a way you know the plot
A,The depth of character is not there
A,So sometimes together with the depth of character and good characterisation good plot with special effects I think it will make a good movie
B,Ya that's right
A,The actors are quite good right in this case
A,E-kin
B,Uhm he fits the persona of A Man Called Hero
B,If you read the comic books he looks almost exactly you know really like the comic hero
B,He fits the role
A,But as a movie is it a good one I mean in terms of uh you know you study films
A,So in terms of that you think is it a good movie
A,You haven't watched it yet actually
B,I haven't watched it yet
B,But I uh read enough I see enough to know a little bit
B,I guess what helps the movie maybe is the chemistry of him
B,He has the a kind of certain charisma that fits the role
B,That melancholic person that walks the earth and knows that whatever relationship people forms with him uh won't stand the test of time
B,That relationship will probably die because he is a curse on earth
B,And he fits the persona you know he looks sad all the time
A,So looks like he has a role to play to to save the world is it
A,But for himself he cannot form meaningful relationships
A,Deep ones
B,Ya deep ones
B,That's why I think in the movie also he has a son
B,And uh he refused to acknowledge him
B,And the son keep asking him why don't you want to acknowledge me
B,Because you know he feels that he is superstitious in a way uh
A,It might interfere with his role as a hero
B,Ya
A,Does he have a wife
B,Ya
B,Yang but she was killed half way through the movie
B,And you know these movies sword fighting movies is always about revenge
A,Aiyah the lady always dies
A,And then the hero will go on
B,Not my story
B,My story won't happen
A,It's all right
A,She's got a role to play
A,She has got nothing to do so she must die
A,Makes it more sad
B,I mean sword fighting movies are always like that hor
B,The ladies are just flower pots
A,What
B,I mean I'm saying sword fighting movies
B,Flower pots
A,Flower pots
A,Uhm I don't like that
B,I don't like that too
A,Make a movie that is different <X>
A,But there are some where the ladies play a part uh I think there was one Chinese show Chinese movie you lent me where the lady also fights
A,Fong Sai Yuk
B,Oh yes the mother
B,That was funny
A,The mother
