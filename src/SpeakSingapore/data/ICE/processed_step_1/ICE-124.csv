A,Good evening and welcome to Points of View
A,For the next few weeks we'll be seeing a lot more performances coming our way
A,This month alone we've had the International Cantonese Opera Festival and Theatre Carnival on the Hill
A,In June it's the Festival of Arts and groups from all over the world will be coming here so clearly Singapore is becoming a vibrant place for the arts
A,But how are the local groups faring
A,Just how far can they go and what will it take to ensure this vibrancy continues
A,To discuss this I have with me the local artistes themselves journalists and corporate sponsors
A,Let me begin with you Ekachai
A,Now you work with Action Theatre and you've been performing on part-time basis and as I understand doing quite well
A,Now what are you doing actually to bring in the audience
B,Uhm well there's I think there's no secret formula but uhm for Action Theatre I think the fact that our group comprises a lot of professionals somehow the way we go about uhm doing marketing our product we tend to have uhm I think what we call a twin focus approach
B,I think you need to focus both on the creative side of the business uh and also the business side of marketing the art uhm so I think that that's that's how we begin so far
A,Okay so you've been quite successful then
B,Uhm
A,But then there are other art uh artistes and performers aren't doing so well
A,Mrs Bhasker could you tell us some of the problems you're facing
A,Now I guess okay the key word here the key issue that we've all been talking so far is marketing
A,Now Robert uhm you bring in some groups overseas groups into Singapore what exactly does marketing entail
C,Uhm one has to access the situation first and see what the competition is uhm and then try and gauge a level at which you can sell your tickets at and uh after doing that then you have to embark on a series of very creative things on how to bring the message to the people
C,And I I would say the first thing would be to look within yourselves and find what are the interesting points about the production that would be uhm of interest to the to the audience and the secondly is to to embark on very creative ways on getting that message across
C,It could be it's simply designing T-shirt it could be distributing hand bills but it could also be uh undertaking very uh unlikely and very entertaining ways of publicising the events here
C,There are countless ways of doing that <&>  Mr Austin)
A,So what are the what are the audiences looking for
A,Is it more commercial <&>  Mr Austin)
A,Sabri
D,Well basically from the Malay theatre scene we have this uh problem of the direction of arts
D,The old school of thought the old guard believe that they shouldn't be any marketing at all
D,You perform that's your obligation to the society
D,And I I felt this is not wrong but it's not really healthy to the development of arts in the Malay community
D,But another another interesting thing that I would like to point out is marketing the arts for Singaporean sake I think uh Mrs Bhaskar was saying that for Indian dance only got Indian uh audience
D,Why can't we do we we devise a marketing stra strategy that can uh pull Chinese audience in Malay drama or Malay audience seeing an Indian dance
D,Uh we are lacking this uh we don't have the audience
D,But the audience are not educated to appreciate other racial arts you see
D,The the problem become so acute in the sense that we are being expose to Western theatre Western and the type of education and I guess sad to say that a lot of people appreciate ballet more or a lot of people go to to see opera more even if they don't under understand the language
A,Okay sorry to interrupt Robert yes
E,Yah I think the uhm mountain efforts is not really what I would call project specific
E,Marketing effort is a sustain effort
E,For example if you look at the so called quote unquote popularity of foreign shows that are brought in here I think one doesn't realise that the foreign shows that are being brought in have already expended an enormous amount of time and money in promoting themselves before even got here
E,And also whereas we tend I think in Singapore to look at it from a project to project basis in the mean time you know between performances between productions we really don't see this effort being maintained
E,You seem just you know when the last curtain fall so that's it's we look forward to the next one not realising in marketing it's a continuous and a total process
A,But who should be responsible for the marketing then
E,I think the organisations themselves should be responsible
E,They must be aware of the fact that as you've mention quite rightly in the beginning they have a product they want to sell the product and they must reach out to the buying public in order to be able to sell the product
A,But Mrs Bhasker now what is the problem with uh you marketing it yourself marketing your performance <X>
A,Mrs Bhasker </X>
F,Sometimes uhm it's very nice for each community to be able to enjoy its own art form
F,But I think especially in a multi-racial society like Singapore it's important for us to be able for a Chinese to be able to enjoy Indian dance or Malay dance or uhm you know uh Chinese opera and things like that
F,So I think perhaps we should try not only to market it to audiences who are familiar with our type of art but also to a more a wider audience so that it becomes a more cultured society
A,Okay how do you go about doing that
A,Does that mean you have to make it more accessible
A,Do you have to commercialise it to a certain degree
G,I personally believe that uhm this ethnic art should become less purist in attitude
G,They should uhm have more collaboration uhm more experimental in in nature and I think uh in that way uh it can lift itself out of from being a folk art in the way folk dance to art
G,I think that they should uhm market themselves in the way that the uh they should uh ex be more experimental
G,Uhm that doesn't mean they are diluting themselves
G,But I think the collaboration should be more on the more established arts like ballet like uh drama like uh Cantonese opera
G,Cantonese opera it's it has caught on in the drama scene
G,People are trying to stage drama in in Cantonese form in opera form and this this will uh raise awareness of uh of the traditional art
A,Okay let me ask you Winnifred now what is it that okay sponsors are looking for when they decide on what uh group to actually sponsor
A,What do they what do they want
H,I don't claim I can speak for all sponsors
H,I would feel that one of the most important criteria is to see to what extent the contribution of sponsors can go to support that particular artiste or that particular group
H,I don't think sponsorship in the arts uhm should be approach from from the sponsors' point of view that this is a mass market
H,There is no mass market in the arts so once the sponsors realise that they should not go into sponsoring the arts with a marketing perspective that is selling more of their products they should see how far their dollar can go in helping that particular group or that particular artiste to further his talent and his craft
B,But I think that people like Shell you know are bombarded with with request for sponsorship all the time and I think as arts groups uh we need to be able to tell the sponsor that sponsor us this is what we can give you in the return I think the times are gone when you have a lot of sponsors who would just throw money and say oh sponsor your art all they need is a logo They need something more
A,Right right to to me that would make a lot that would a lot of sense
A,If I were a sponsor I mean I would be looking for uhm a product or a group of people that could actually bring in more audience and promote my you know my own cer my own uh product
A,That's that's not happening with a lot of art groups A lot of art groups are not getting the people in and that's way it's difficult for them to find sponsors
A,Well Theatreworks is drawing in the audiences
I,But uh if you look at uh I think you cannot just say that uh we'll sponsor you if you bring in the audience
I,I think some sponsorship is developmental in the sense that you know there's no guarantee that there will be a pay-off at the end I think an example is
A,But not all sponsors are as altruistic as that I mean they have personally they have personally uhm
B,Yes but sponsors also look at that developmental point of view and uh uh I think that if you just want the guarantee of the audience then it's going to be a bad for the arts
B,Of course you know uh sponsors deserve to get the dollar uhm mileage for the dollar to be put in but also there's the other side
A,Okay
H,I would say that one of the very important points that has been touched on by Tan How when it comes to how sponsors uh assess whether to go in for a sponsorship
H,If our assessment of the potential of it that particular person or that particular group how far do we think he or she or that group can go in their artistic attainment and fulfilment That is very important
A,Okay that is a good point
A,Good that brings us to the next point
A,Now do we actually have that sort of quality
A,Do we have enough of those people uh that sponsors are looking for John
A,So there is an overkill
I,Are you saying that sponsors should only sponsor the man and not the boys
A,Sorry uhm Ekachai go ahead
B,I think it has a lot to do more with the quality of the artistic product I think part-time necessary does not necessarily equal amateurish
B,In fact I think in the way our our cultures cultural scene is growing there are a lot of part-time groups that are producing very very quality uh good quality work compared to say product say professional companies
B,Professional companies are constraint by the fact that they have to come up with a season
B,There are how many plays the theatres are booked are booked full you know they have to fill the theatre spaces so they have to come up with the plays and num and certain number of production whereas part-time groups can they can be passion driven and they don't need to be you know uh survival driven or profit driven
A,Do we need a central body to actually coordinate with when these performances actually come on
E,I don't think so
E,I think in the long-term it's all a learning process for for all of us now
E,I think in the long-term the market will in fact decide how to this thing is going to pan out
E,"Uhm if we look at the experience of the Festival of Arts which has been running about for ten twelve years fourteen years now uhm despite the fact that it's only held, once every two years a biennial event It falls very naturally into the June period and the we for example now find that there are other groups who are planning to perform in Singapore planning the schedule around the festival <X>"
E,For example I believe Moscow circus is coming in again a around the festival time but they are not part of the festival but they lock in very nicely and come in early into the schedule or the festival </X> </I>
