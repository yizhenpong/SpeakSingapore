1,So class I hope that you will be able to share with your classmates those who are coming in now what I've explained to you about the sixty four cards and what you're supposed to do
1,It is an individual response so there are no right or wrong answer
1,I'll like to begin my lecture today by telling you that we have now come to the last lecture in our series on human resource management
1,We have gone a long journey
1,I hope you have found it interesting
1,It was taught it was quite a number of months when I welcomed you to Ngee Ann Polytechnic and when I welcomed you to do this Human Resource Management program and we had got a few breaks in between and now dinner is ahead
1,Well it'll be nice if we can all go for dinner and celebrate but we can't do that now because your exam is just ahead of you
1,Today we want to deal on creativity
1,We want to deal on creative problem solving
1,A couple of weeks ago you had a lecture on the rational problem-solving approach today we are not doing the rational problem-solving approach we are doing the creative problem-solving approach and if you recall in our film on the ABC of decision making the conclusion was that it is actually very good if you can base your decision on number one
1,Cold hard facts and at the same time combine it with some intuition and individual judgement
1,In other words we cannot just simply rely on cold hard facts
1,There are some problems and particularly when they affect people we have also look at it from the creative approach
1,In other words we have to look at and find some new ideas
1,So here you see two people having ideas but one of them uh sort of give up and do not follow up on the idea whereas another one follows up on the idea and cover up with some innovation
1,So I'm sure you realise that many of the innovations we have today are because someone have a good idea and was able to apply that idea and uh I hope that you have read through your notes on creative problem solving page one
1,I'll not go into detail about some of the definitions you should know for example what is discovery
1,Is discovery something already existing but unnoticed uh for example someone discovered the law of gravity
1,Gravity has always been there but nobody sort of discovered it or didn't notice it until somebody noticed an apple falling and asked why how come the apple fall like this why not fall upwards or fall sideways huh
1,So I hope that uh you would also discover many things and you would also notice many things
1,It's always good to open your eyes uh
1,I noticed today for example that not all students are here
1,Is it correct
1,I don't know where they are
1,So you know what is invention and innovation huh
1,Basically invention you are doing something entirely new
1,It's a new invention like before the telephone was invented uh
1,That was really a new invention
1,There was nothing before that like that huh
1,But it can also replace something old of course and this is where innovation also helps to modify or update or refine an existing product
1,So all this requires creative thinking and I'd like you to page to uh turn to page two where you have got uh the four mental powers
1,I hope by now after reading these notes you are made aware that actually we have a very good brain and we have got four mental powers
1,One of them is the power to absorb to observe to sense and to be attentive
1,I hope that you are paying me attention now or be attentive to me and referring to your notes and you are absorbing through your senses now through your eyes and through your ears
1,You are able to learn something that there is one mental power called the absorptive power and I believe that in the past week or so you have absorbed a lot of information and you have learnt a lot I hope
1,And the second power that we have of course is a retentive power that means we not only able to absorb we are able also to retain in our mind we can memorise things we can retain we can recall
1,And it is of course very good to have a this retentive ability in all of us and I believe that we all does have some very good memories
1,It's a matter of uh knowing how to memorise using various tools to memorise for example I have told you how you can memorise the main points about why do people resist change you can't forget that any more right
1,We all don't like to have the sack to be sacked uh s-a-c and you know how you can uh sort of uh make it more accepting to people where you make some changes
1,Use NPB and UCC
1,All these are just some tools for you to help you to retain and to recall and I'm sure you can recall many things in the past especially those things that you find very meaningful very interesting well of course we also forget quite number of things especially those things we find very boring those things which are no more relevant huh unfortunately
1,And in fact I just went to my mechanic yesterday and he recall the last time I my car broke down was in the World Trade Centre
1,He could recall that he talked to me over the phone
1,I was very amazed
1,So you see how uh if you can know your customers well like this uh it's very useful actually
1,Now this is how we learn
1,But of course we do not only uh have these two mental power
1,We also can reason
1,We can also be creative and this is where I have taught you a bit more about thinking and I have uh shared with you in a few lectures before on the rational problem-solving approach where the main emphasis is to use reason the main emphasis is to analyze things to assess to evaluate to judge and to come to certain conclusion based on various logic or various reasons huh
1,That is the rational problem-solving approach and we all can reason
1,However there's only one mental power and we also need to now come to the fourth mental power called the creative mental power that we have and this is the ability in which we can generate ideas and we need to have more and better ideas
1,We need to be able to foresee things and we can only foresee things if we use our creative mental power
1,We need to able to visualize to see ahead and this visualization that we have which of course has to do with our power of imagination uhm
1,They we all say that we inside our mind there's what's called a mind's eye
1,There's an eye there huh
1,It's just an illustration to say that we can imagine visualize we can feel
1,Can you imagine now getting the diploma
1,Can you imagine
1,Yes you can imagine
1,Can you imagine Mr Teo sitting in the hall clapping one by one as you come up to receive your diploma
1,Can you imagine
1,Can you see Mr Teo
1,Yes you can imagine
1,I can also imagine you coming up in a very nice white dress uh most of the students are wearing white on that day
1,Very smart
1,Can you imagine
1,Yes you can
1,It is very important for us to be able to imagine certain things and this is where we come to the imagination the power of imagination
1,There is creative imagination and <unclear> word </unclear> imagination visual imagination and vicarious imagination
1,So you read the facts on your own
1,It says there that uh our imagination will affect our emotion because just now as I talked to you about graduation day you have a sense already of achievement of pride of happiness all my two years working here had come to the fruition huh
1,Can you imagine it
1,You can feel
1,Affect your emotion and there the untapped power of imagination almost unlimited
1,We are not tapping it enough uhm
1,According to psychologists we only use only ten to twenty percent of our mental potential and uh imagine at four different parts the creative imagination where you try to imagine something creatively huh
1,Take for example my friend or my colleague uh she did this
1,I think it's very nice she just bring all these to get I can't do this uh
1,But it shows that she could imagine and she could creatively that create a bouquet like this
1,Put it in a nice place uh appropriate places
1,Anticipative imagination
1,What you expect you shall find
1,So what do you anticipate
1,If you can anticipate for example this question will come out that question is more important
1,It is very useful
1,You would anticipate your boss to be very angry today your boss will be very nice today
1,Your boss will be asking you this
1,Your boss will be asking you that
1,It is very good to be able to anticipate uhm
1,The visual imagination uhm you're able to see certain things visually
1,So some of us can see better things than others huh
1,We can imagine very clearly
1,When I talked to you about graduation day you can see not only people you can see colours and so on uhm
1,At last vi vicarious uh
1,That means you can feel for others
1,I imagine that when I said that to him he would have felt very happy or he would have felt very sad
1,If you can have a vicarious imagination it's also very useful in your interpersonal relationship huh
1,How do the other party feel
1,How would he have felt
1,If I were in his shoe how would I have felt or how would he have felt huh
1,So all these things I hope you would see it to be of value to you and we go on to the how does the mind therefore develop a new thought
1,Page three
1,Are you following me on page three uhm
1,This's also a very interesting uh thing because it tells you that our mind works in a progressive manner and first of all we must sense or we must recognize that there is a problem
1,If we don't recognize of course we don't we can't uh proceed and so there are two aspect of it
1,One is to be able to detect the problem and the other one is to able to find a new approach to the problem
1,So actually what is the problem
1,Problem definition here and to approach it from a different angle huh
1,Next preparation
1,You have to prepare yourself gather various facts on uh data that is pertinent to the problem and this part of it actually is very necessary uh
1,You have to prepare
1,There is no short cut uhm
1,Unless you got certain input you can't really proceed very well
1,But after you got all the necessary input and you're able to sense or to recognize the problem from different angles then you come to a more uh subconscious or even unconscious called incubation where you are sleeping over the problem
1,Somebody will say aiyah I think we cannot find the answer today let us sleep over it and think it over you know in our quieter time or something like that and you will find that this is uh where your mind your conscious mind then let your unconscious mind that means a bigger part of your mind think about it and sometimes you may have realized that uh after you had a good sleep you wake up oh you say ah I have found the solution oh now I know the solution huh <X>
