A,Singapore Telecom we work with eighty three service providers
A,Service providers are the people that provide the information
A,Okay we do not provide the information
A,What we do is <unclear> word </unclear> the central system
A,The service provider provide the information and you as the/your <unclear> word </unclear> users will retrieve the information from the main database okay

A,Now there are two ways the user could communicate with the main computer
A,It's either by Uachat <unclear> word </unclear> or through the PSTN
A,That's the Public Service Telephone Network
A,Now if by any chance the reception is not good okay the machine will automatically tape <unclear> word </unclear> into the PSTN which means that you'll be communicating with us through the Public Service Telephone Network
A,The development through the Public Service Telephone Network may not be as quick as its Give you an example

C,What are those information
A,Uh Philips Securities is one of them If/Ain't <unclear> word </unclear> that many closer There are many close user groups uh these are service providers and they want to cater information to a selected <unclear> word </unclear> Remember Singapore Telecom in Teleview we're providing information we work together with service providers None are hardware business with <unclear> word </unclear> information information that is growing Right now a hundred thousand pages ten thousand customers eighty three service providers and then this is only the tip of the iceberg that's going We are at the forefront of information okay So the Education Education We have what we call for primary school students a very comprehensive supplementary program that uh supplements the cur current school curriculum We have a SMART packed program A SMART packed program is some kind of you know have you heard of the Kinkino assessment program Uh children do work on assessments they are tested Okay with here what you do is you do your test on this thing but you can only do it once your test and you are graded and you are ranked So you roughly know where you are as opposed to as compared to the comparing yourself with the other student(s </&> Go ahead and have a have a try now
C,Um okay who are the people that uh program all these information on education Who are these people
A,Singapore Chinese Teachers' Union Singapore Tamil(s) Teachers' Union Singapore Malay Teachers Union and the main body Singapore <unclear> word </unclear> uh Singapore Teachers' Union We work closely with them They're our main one of our main service providers through education Now for the SMART program is done by the Singa all these four uh teachers' union and we gear them towards asking them to provide uh tests that are slightly a shade more difficult
C,How often is it being updated the information
A,Information Now certain certain things are rated uh we there are six SMART Caps uh six which are in SMART Cap uh <unclear> word </unclear> six This is this is a line <unclear> word </unclear> six this will explain to you what SMART cap is and nuh it's it it's uh Mathematics Science English Chinese all the and all the other test program Uh you can have this one Let me get you another one These are just only pieces of service directory <unclear> word </unclear> another copy Now one of the key things about this thing as opposed to some other learning aid is the fact that for children at the primary school level you have graphics you know colourful it draws the attention and uh it is not never dull there there's never a dull moment You you you get children onto computers at a very young age and it's only what Nine dollars Now nine dollars is the subscription a month which is nine dollars Do you have a computer at Okay it's a model two two thirty uh on a two eighty six a three eighty six or four eighty six Now there're two ways of communicating Can you get into the demo demo page Uh Teleview is communicator is interactive Teletext's system is one way Teleview in two way We set it by <unclear> word </unclear> and you communicate with the machine through a PSTN Public Service Telephone Network Uh you come with if there's no if the reception is poor by some interference it'll automatically <unclear> word </unclear> and everything will be done through the PSTN So remember it's communicative it's it's interactive and uh and for nine dollars only a month subscription Now we offer here for two hundred and thirty five dollars a modem and a receiver card Now receiver card if by modem if you were to you choose by modem the development is much is slightly slower If it <unclear> word </unclear> with with a RF card receiver card fast development fast retrieve development C4: So uh if let's say we're using television there's uh no...
A,Television This is is it C4: without the others
A,<unclear> word </unclear> Ya it's a mark two It's only five fifty
C,You all if you're using a computer I do not need to get that
A,No you don't need this This is a dedicated terminal These are for people who do not have a PC at home at this right moment
C,Just now you were saying if I use a modem it's slower If I use what then it's faster
A,It's a RF card
C,R
A,There there's an RF card C4: In here O: All built in
A,All built in You see this is a O: The modem
A,simple O: Ya the modem and the receiver card are all built in into this dedicated terminal
A,Swan Tah is the planning engineer
C,So if I use a computer it will be slower
A,Nope Computer with the RF card You want to see how fast it is
C,Where's the RF card
A,The RF card with a twelve hundred mode uh with a modem is two hundred and thirty five dollars O: It's a good offer Buy
A,You try to get a modem outside it's a few hundred dollars worth okay So it's only two hundred and thirty five dollars and what we do is for a small installation now most all computers unless you go through our uh distributors We've ran out the list of our distributors now We're selling it like hot cakes <unclear> word </unclear> Okay unless you go to uh some of our distributors where they they they they have the RF vision <unclear> word </unclear> But for us all you do is this for two hundred and thirty five dollars you get this price for a small amount we'll we'll have someone sent down and install the RF card for you We will inform you Mrs Quek now sign the thing and two weeks we'll either a week and a half or two weeks we'll give you an ID come downto get the the the software You need a software All you do is software and we'll do the rest for you You subscribe now assistance for a small amount Now this thing is there is only a small amount it's a couple <unclear> word </unclear> of investment It's an investment The fact that if you use this for your child you can use it for yourself Telebanking you know The thing is when we retrieve the information <unclear> word </unclear>
C,You're always improving on the information on the services and whatever
A,Yes yes I must emphasize that
C,and the price remain the same
A,The price will remain the same Nine dollars subscription We want to get Singaporeans to be at the forefront of the information retrieval This information is catered to you It's integrated and that is the key thing about Teleview Information You you can get this information at the paper but the fact that you have to go through the paper look you may miss it But if you want something Teleview <unclear> word </unclear> It's all in it
C,Even the news
A,News Reuters I mean the usual thing people will <unclear> word </unclear> first come up to me and say 'Oh I do not have time' I do not have time to do this I do not have time to watch TV I do not have time to read papers But precisely this is what we want to help you do Save time so that you'll still have information at your tip of your finger
C,Are the news really news
A,It is new I mean it may not be CNN okay
C,But can I copy the information for into a...
A,You have a printer
C,Yes O: You need hard copy But uh
A,You will be
C,But I cannot copy it copy into my computer hard disk or diskette or... O: Only hard copy
A,If we allow that everyone will pass one and then before we know it we're pressing ourselve(s </&> out uh Ya I mean only <unclear> word </unclear> the planning engineer O: Ya
A,He is the You you talking of people who work on this thing and will make it as comprehensive as advanced as we possibly can Now we have had uh questions from all over the world and they say that we are the best still We are the first and we're still one of the best uh the in terms of customer base we're we're very large C4: So who are the people who pay you all <unclear> word </unclear> extra we use you see of the...
A,Yes we will send you We have schools that you can go to your fee <unclear> word </unclear> or you just go <unclear> word </unclear> for We will inform you on what to do Any questions people at sales counter will <unclear> word </unclear> to you <unclear> word </unclear> O: To access the information is very simple There are only there are three ways to access the information First we go through the we go by uh indexing See this is our main index so you just key in the number accordingly For example if you want uh the news Eleven Okay from here another index so you go by this way Okay This is our first method The second method is uh the key word For example if you want to stock exchange Say uh PCS share See here we are or you remember the page number Okay for example SIA seven four seven <&>  747 </&> Very easy very user-friendly
A,The as I said the advantage is the fact that you miss this information if you retrieve it on the paper The fact that you go round hunting for it You you waste time hunting for it C4: The information for that day the <unclear> word </unclear> paper you find that you want to check through last week newspaper or last month newspaper where are you going to <unclear> word </unclear>
A,Oh then you would have to go to Archives to C4: But now the information is for today
C,It's the latest
A,I mean if let's say let's say news without <unclear> word </unclear> O: News that's why it's called news
A,Ya you you let's let's news means current C4: But I miss the newspaper so I want to retrieve uh last week's news
C,Ya C4: So is it possible
C,Can
A,Then we
C,Oh maybe I heard someone said 'Oh last week did you read this news about this ' I didn't Can I C4: Ah I didn't read newspaper ya O: Uh no
A,No O: News is always uh the most updated C4: the updated O: Yes
A,Ya O: But then Four-D <&>  4-D </&> and Toto result can
A,I don't want to say that
C,So let's say tonight the nine o'clock news okay I will have to say news as it's being <unclear> word </unclear> right Nine
A,Very likely Now the thing is this information is provided by Singapore Press Holding(s </&> Singapore These are the people who work for Straits Time(s </&> They commit themselve(s </&> to putting upto-date information O: Singapore Telecom(s </&> is the network operator
A,Ya O: So information are provided by the service provider
A,We we are the conduit you know we <unclear> word </unclear> have the customer and then we have the service providers C4: So we are the ones supposed to
A,Correct we provide the system we support the system O: But right now all our service provider they are very dedicated They update their information very frequently
A,They see this as a another C4: So we go through uh actually print out in whatever <unclear> word </unclear> O: IDS <unclear> word </unclear> into the printer and you can print your We have a lot of services that are actually on-line Singapore Stock Exchange Flight information uh Inland Revenue CPF um government tender C4: CPF that means to say we can actually check our account O: Yes You want to check now

C,Who are the banks O: Banking Okay One method by keywords
C,I find that when you type the it's quite slow you see O: Um because um I typed slowly
C,No no no sorry the letter didn't appear fast O: Oh you know why because this information is actually sent to the central system and echo back If you are if you have if you have experience working with uh mainframe muh it's precisely the same same situation
A,It will never never be instantaneous O: Ya
A,The thing is you you know standardize actual fact <unclear> word </unclear> uh It's fast considering O: Yes
