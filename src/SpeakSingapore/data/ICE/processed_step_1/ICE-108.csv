speaker,speech
A,You can sit here if you want
A,I can't see that
B,Where
A,Okay so you had more time to prepare
C,Yah
A,What do you think are the what do you were are the problems with section five which have either been solved or not solved
A,Can we just go through a list of them David
D,I think there's still the difficulty of <unclear> word </unclear> that issue if you
A,Okay
D,Use the <unclear> word </unclear> 's evidence to quote
A,Okay so so take so try to think of it as a kind of a a structure okay
A,I mean number one you must know the cases prior to the amendment
A,What were the problems with this thing prior to the amendment okay
A,And then has each one of these problems been solved by the <unclear> word </unclear> Amendment
A,If so how if it hasn't why or has it created new problems I mean I mean that's the basic structure which which I want you to look at
A,Okay you you say it hasn't solved the framing of the issue of question why
A,<O> cough </O>
D,Because there's there's been no direction made out as to uhm how you <&> telephone rings </&> how you frame the issue
A,Hello yah hi Debbie nope no why on what how about yourself not coming uh not coming is it
A,That's what announcement do you want
A,Okay I'll ask her you don't want them is it
A,Michael is doing a lecture
A,Uhm ya I think
A,Okay don't don't don't too much
A,It's semi-terrorism
A,We'll tell Michael okay
A,I'll tell him whether you need them but uh ya it's okay
A,Bye Okay framing of <unclear> word </unclear>
D,Uhm
A,Are you still reading that one
B,No I just I need the three act the acting one
A,Uhm you should read the other one lah
B,Uhm
A,Which I'm sure your have read
B,Uhm
A,Okay yes David go on
D,Because uh compared to the prior to the amendment there's an an uh new <unclear> word </unclear> and a and amendment uhm there's there's no additional instruction laid down as to how you should approach and frame the issue
A,Okay so you you're starting out by assuming that framing the issue of question is a problem uh
B,Uhm
A,I assume
D,Yes
A,So will you think that there're different levels of framing the issue
A,At certain levels if you frame the issue it could possibly question of issue <unclear> word </unclear> other levels no
A,But what do you think uh Su Ann
A,Will you have problem
B,Not very sure uhm I think it depends on which approach you want to uh you want to take
B,If you set the actions approach which seems to be the favourite approach nowadays then you don't have to
A,Uhm you see that's one way of actually without looking at the <unclear> word </unclear> amendments trying to solve the problem within the cases itself
A,That that's one way of seeing
A,Well the problem only exists under Lon and Dalton's approach
A,If you look at <unclear> word </unclear> 's way of framing or frame the issue of question then the problem won't exist
A,Anything
A,And and how would you do it yah
C,For acting's approach got to oh you know what <unclear> word </unclear> all is
A,Ah okay that that could be a problem or okay that that see that's a problem which will not exist for uh would never have existed under <unclear> word </unclear> 's approach
A,But now exists under Atkins' approach
A,And the problem is even if you were to say that okay that that's the first first difficulty right framing of issue of question
A,Let's go on to the next one
A,We'll sort of follow from what you said earlier on
A,Number one Atkins if you follow Atkins approach in framing the issue of question I want you to know the meaning of multicarlaw
A,That has not been settled
A,Of course unless the legislative said we leave it to the cases to decide I mean basically it's the Common Law that <unclear> word </unclear> that gives us law
A,Not really satisfactory but but you know there's been an entire range of dicta right
A,Some cases say well mercantile law's not the same as law merchant then you've got <unclear> word </unclear> <unclear> word </unclear> <unclear> word </unclear> and the and the earlier ones I mean <unclear> word </unclear> the whole range of definitions from mercantile law plus you see under Lord Dalton's approach this would not have been a problem at all because the law there would have meant English law
A,Okay but if you take the words with respect to those matters as having qualified the law with strictly to with strictly to mercantile law then again the definition of mercantile law becomes important you see which again is non-settlement yah but the law any problem Siew Hwa
A,The law with respect to those matters
A,Was it necessary
A,Any anything it solves
E,Uhm the word law itself
A,Be that the law the applicable law see you covered the <unclear> word </unclear> you covered the definition what about the applicable law
A,Has that been settled
A,Was it a problem as the amendment have
E,It's still a problem
A,<O> cough </O> Why
E,Has it has it to do with the section
E,You're talking about written law
A,No no no not that section
A,The applicable law uhm the law which comes in via section five
D,Well it seems that I think the amendments is trying to qualify that the law the law can be applied in Singapore
A,Okay so again you have two diff conflicting approaches under
A,You have to explain the problem
A,Lord Dalton's approach the whole law of English the whole of English sort of come in Atkins' approach only mercantile law does come in
A,So you've got two different approaches
A,Now again has that been settled by the <unclear> word </unclear> amendment
A,So divided the words with respect to this matter
A,You see for each one of them you start out by saying okay number one there were two different approaches
A,Was there a problem I mean was it was it a conflict or was it more of a a <unclear> word </unclear> you know was there a conflict
A,If there's a conflict it's <unclear> word </unclear>
A,If there's no conflict then <unclear> word </unclear> amendments really <unclear> word </unclear>
A,Do you uh you don't have to say everything was a problem
A,You may say that I think although that <O> telephone rings </O>
A,Hello hello yep okay alright thanks bye
A,You see just remember if it's not a conflict at all then you don't have to to go on and really try to see whether it solve the problem like like for example let me take a more fundamental point
A,Do you think that the two approaches are in conflict with one another
D,Yes
A,Do you think the approaches are conflicting enough
A,Think carefully I mean if you say that they are conflicting approaches fine uhm bear in mind except Lord Atkins says he does not disagree with Lord Dalton
A,Do you think they are conflicting approaches
A,You may argue they are conflicting in the sense that they lead to totally different results or someone may argue that well they're not really conflicting they are the same
A,It's just that the starting point of the entire thing is different which actually lead to different results but the approaches are itself not conflicting
B,But I don't I don't see how the approaches are the same
A,Okay it's the same issue of question okay the law can be applied okay qualification correct
B,But the law we applied is different
A,Only because when you frame the issue of question you frame the issue but or question by looking at the mercan at at the law
A,So if the law is mercantile law there'll be a issue of question restrict to mercantile law which means the law coming in would be mercantile law it has to be
A,But the issue in the statute of the question is not mercantile law no issue of question with respect to mercantile law it won't come in
A,Do you follow
A,The starting point actually <unclear> word </unclear>
A,You will say that that could mean that the approach is the same or one could equally argue <unclear> word </unclear> they're completely different
B,Oh
A,Right 'cos it leads to completely different results as in entire different way because that is not the way Lord Dalton will frame the issue of question law you know Lord Atkins frames it in a very different way I mean you can come to completely different results but you you don't have to sort of take what the book says is correct all the time
A,Okay okay uhm the law with respect to those matters
A,What used to come in and <unclear> word </unclear> the amendments up
A,David you said
D,Yah I think uhm the amendment was trying was trying to qualify the law applicable in Singapore because he added in 'with respect to those matters' so I would think they would be trying to qualify uh the law to maybe laws relating to banking principles and etcetera
A,Or you can say you think that there was a <unclear> word </unclear> and that this makes it clear that not all law comes in but only mercantile law comes in
D,Yah
A,At this stage I mean you can compare this with the object and purpose of section five and and again you got a whole string of <unclear> word </unclear> law
A,You think the amendment makes it more consistent with our object and purpose of section five
B,It it qualifies the law to be applied to that restricted to mercantile law only
A,Okay fine
A,Any other problem on this section ah in in the old uh in the amend pre-amendment cases
A,Don't don't look at the <unclear> word </unclear> okay
A,Look at the cases first
A,Ask yourself okay what were all the problems that exist
A,Okay you've covered the issue of question okay you covered the law applicable we've covered the problems of definition of mercantile law we've covered the question of whether the two approaches are different
A,What other problems you think you're interested
D,<unclear> word </unclear>
A,Okay <unclear> word </unclear> Okay before we talk <unclear> word </unclear> can we talk about the general applicability
A,Now you remember that was never a problem until <unclear> word </unclear> 'cos it's it's something they never really have to consider <unclear> word </unclear>
A,No in <unclear> word </unclear> you find that all three courts don't want the money lent back to the client
A,The more important dictas the is to be shift one to the High Court
A,I think it's uhm <unclear> word </unclear> very good dictum at the last paragraph uh that the moneylender side are not capable of this thing their sections are so interdependent provides for machinery and everything else
A,Now look at the dicta
A,They'll give the case okay
A,Can you take the last paragraph <unclear> word </unclear> activities okay
A,You have the case with you Su Ann
A,You think so
A,Good I'm sure you'll find it
A,The last para okay no it's it's a very im important point
A,The High Court <unclear> word </unclear> activity
A,You didn't have it
A,Do you have it
A,The High Court <unclear> word </unclear> will shakes up
A,Can't be that difficult to find
B,<unclear> word </unclear>
A,Yah okay read read the last paragraph
B,Okay uhm I'll like the defence of the real act
B,hese acts in question have no white imperial concern or <unclear> word </unclear>
B,They are very special municipal ways of legislating the region creating creating procedure and machinery and setting up restrictions and sanctions which are quite impossible to Christian ideas
A,Okay let's let's just stop there
A,Do you think that they're very special municipal ways of provision creating procedure and machinery setting up restrictions and sections penalty uh
A,Ah impossible application okay
A,Now ask yourself carefully is this is he talking generally about ah acts suitable or not suitable or is he saying that if an act creates for procedure and machinery and sets up restrictions and sanctions restrictions can be probably licensing and sanctions will be penalty
A,Are his remarks directed at a general applicability test or he's talking about a specific <unclear> word </unclear>
B,Moneylender's Act
A,No not so much moneylender's act
A,Is he talking about an act which creates restrictions sanctions procedure and machinery
A,Is he talking about that <X>
A,Do you know what I mean
A,It's interesting because you you take you see okay then you go to look at Lord Atkin Lord okay because he to create this exception uhm <unclear> word </unclear> relied on the word perfect law and its application correct and and that has been discredited so that is all
A,Now Lord Atkin does the same thing Right Lord Atkin says the same thing He says oh you know there's an implied exception correct not found there but but hid it's an implied <unclear> word </unclear> and this the thing that Soon and Pang criticise Right they they say that oh section five it's not possible for section five to have this implied exception not found within the words of the section itself They criticise that part okay So the next question we went on to uh the section five three a allow for this suitability test and to that the answer was no because five three a says modify and adapt whatever has already come in but the suitability test applies at the stage where it determines whether not something comes in so that can't be the one so that that they've argued it as a problem right And think about it carefully If what um <unclear> word </unclear> activity did what Lord Atkin wa talking about in fact Atkin's remark was somewhat similar to her I'm not a general suitability test but they're only talking about acts which create licensing you know concerned with licensing penalties registration Is that exception provided in <unclear> word </unclear> </X>
B,Ya
A,It is you see Do you do you see again it it depends on how you read the cases if you say well here they were not I mean they were not so specific as to talk about registration sanctions and and procedure and everything They're talking about suitability test okay and Lord Atkin talks about the implied suitability test not found within the words of section five So that was the problem Where did he find the legislative basis for it Then you ask yourself That's the nineteen seventy nine amendment solved then Give you the problem now it doesn't really solve that right Because Soon and Pang say modify that and that cannot mean suitability But if you start out by saying wer um the words uhm which <unclear> word </unclear> activity gave and Lord Atkin says I'm not a general suitability test but I'll confine to act s which create procedure and machinery licensing and penalty that has been provided for under this amendment so that problem has been solved as well and there's no need and so the bulk argument as well there's no need for a general applicability test Well I mean that that's their basic premise They say no you don't have to have a general applicability test then that is solved but then that depends on how you read it If you read this as a wide applicability test then of course you'll have problems later on that's all </X> </I>
