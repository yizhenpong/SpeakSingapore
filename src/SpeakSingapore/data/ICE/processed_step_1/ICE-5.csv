B,*laughs*
C,Well it's only a one-day tour
D,Did then why don't you go with her
C,Why didn't I go
C,Because it was all ladies
C,They are going and go and shop and one thing which I don't like to do is to shop
D,But you can always go there and do other things what
D,You sit auto and watch video
A,Or go to the pool and laze around
C,Stereo I don't know
C,Today suddenly we all seem to be so quiet
A,You need you need some key players
C,Yah as though we felt that our voices will be recorded
A,We need Su Lian
A,Su Lian will probably say something like 'Oh yes yes lah
A,What do you want me to say
A,And then she'll go on
C,But these days you never know
C,Uh they could be recording your voices anywhere
A,Over the telephone ah
C,Yah even now while we are counting money
A,Ah <unclear> word </unclear> Is it illegal
C,Ss not illegal lah
A,I know the police and all that do that lah
C,Uhm
A,But isn't that illegal
A,It's illegal overseas
C,There's no right of privacy here
A,Ha Singapore ah
C,Yah
A,Really ah
A,What do you mean no right of privacy at all
D,You mean in the States they couldn't do that
A,No they they
C,<unclear> word </unclear>
A,Apparently they can tape your phone conversation and use it as a what evidence in court ah
C,The only thing they can't do is give your IC number your your address
C,If you write to <unclear> word </unclear> because there's a some uh section in the National Registration Act which says that whatever information inside there
D,But they wouldn't know it's
C,is private and confidential except to the authorities
D,But then they have to prove that it's it was you on the phone nah
A,Easy what
C,Yah
D,How
A,Probably get you to talk on the phone again and do a voice read
C,Uhm
A,Okay could you snore
A,I want you to read this sentence
A,I want you to read these these same words
D,But how proof how fool-proof is
D,uh how fool-proof is a voice
C,Yes not fool-proof
C,You know you can never proof by uh signature yah
C,The
A,So forgery all that lah
C,In Singapore at least none of the I mean tech officers will go down and confirm that that is the writing of someone
D,But this kind of things they will only do if it's something real serious like
C,Yah
D,you you confess that you murdered someone or you posted to your friends
C,Yah
C,No they'll probably send it to England and give someone to positively confirm
A,As a <unclear> word </unclear>
C,Yah
A,as evidence
C,Yah
D,So what is actually the amount of tapes they use
C,Yah
A,So if you don't have right of privacy right you mean down here you don't need a warrant to walk into your house
C,They need
A,So there's still privacy there what
C,I know but privacy in the sense of recording your conversations
D,So there's no sanctuary not like in the Old Testament times where you can run to a village and then nobody can
A,Or run run to a church ah
D,Then how
D,Or run to your room
A,Why
D,The sanctuary
D,Would would they arrest someone in the sanctuary
C,I don't think they want
C,They'll probably wait until
D,So so you go you go there and you just sit there and sit tight you know
A,'A' in countries uh you are
C,But then you charge uh an embassy they wouldn't go into an embassy what
A,Yah because neutral ground
C,Because neutral yah it's considered part of the territory of the other country
D,the other country
A,So so so would the church be neutral ground
C,No
D,The land still owns the government still owns the land
C,Yah yah
D,Embassy
C,Embassy no
C,It's part of the
A,But overseas it is isn't it
C,Yeh
C,That's why you have certain cases like that <unclear> word </unclear>
D,So let's say you rob a bank uh you carry a bundle of money like that you you know you run and police chasing you and you jump into the
C,Yah
A,embassy F&
C,The embassy
A,The embassy'll probably find out that you are a robber and throw you out lah
C,Yah
C,No they I mean if even in that sort of a situation if the police run in
D,They
C,I think they wouldn't
D,They won't lah
C,raise a fuss about it lah
C,So by because at the end of the day you must see what are they going to do
C,Are they going to declare war
C,Or cut off diplomatic relations
D,Over you uh over a bank over a bank robber only
C,Yah
A,We may we may do some diplomatic relations with Russia ah
C,Yah
A,Su Lian is there
D,Ooh I took it just so that I can donate to to the poor people in Russia
A,And Russian will probably say something like
D,Buy food buy food for the poor children
A,The lawyer probably say something like I don't know you know you don't know I don't know uh
A,It probably saves in efforts
C,Yeh
C,Well this is the last session of the year
D,It's very quiet session
D,So aren't you going to turn it off </I>
