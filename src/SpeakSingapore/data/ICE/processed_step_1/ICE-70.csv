speaker,speech
A,So what do you think of the A E presentation we had yesterday
B,Uhm it was okay
B,We we got to know about their projects uhm the outcome why they choose the projects the type of methodology they use the philosophical underpinnings etcetera
B,So how then
B,How you gonna present yours
A,I haven't actually think about it but from what yesterday the impression is that uh there's not much of questions being posed to the presenters lah and I personally hope that the presenters and the teacher might not take it might not take questions uhm too personally
A,I mean not as an attack uh personal attack or something like that
A,It's just a purely academic enquiry something like that
A,So it will be more interesting in that sense lah because actually there's a lot of uh things that I wanted to ask lah but judging from the face of the presenter I dare not lah because they might think otherwise you see
A,So that is the thing you know
B,And I guess the other problem is that it deals with Physical Geography and it's not our line so call so we may not be able to to to discuss the issue in greater depth and in detail and also we may not know that issues in
A,You didn't take Physical Geog
B,I do I do but really another way in in to think it is that uhm I don't want to ask too many questions and because you not not only
A,Bad guy
B,Not the bad guy but simply you you know they standing down there they'll be very very
A,Nervous
B,Nervous
A,And I mean
B,And they don't want to be asked
B,Yes and not only that you know it no matter you are the first batch or the later batch if you are down there you'll be very nervous and you hope that nobody gonna ask you questions because there's always this fear whereby what happen if I cannot answer
A,Oh
B,Right
A,So be it
B,I know so be it but you know you'll you'll definitely feel that you failed you know like you are not that good but especially when you you notice that there are people who would are able to do pretty well and you are comparing yourself with him so you <unclear> word </unclear>
B,Oh I might have done that bad so I won't get that much good grades you know something
A,Sometime their presentation is
B,Ya I admit
A,It's just a
B,Ya ya
A,Part of the grading
A,It's not the whole of the grading you see so you shouldn't be bog down to anxiety or you know being not able to answer the questions but must take it in the positive light lah positive spirit that's the whole thing
A,Then there's a lively discussion nah not a very quiet session just a presenter doing his job or something
B,But I guess it I guess the topic dealt with is Physical so no people really bother or they don't know they're not in the line to to ask questions so I guess when it comes to the later portion
A,Ya maybe the Human
B,The Human side whereby there'll be more people asking more question because you are more familiar with the issues
A,Ya
B,Ya definitely
A,So your your topic falls under what
B,Okay mine is Behavioural meaning that I'm looking at the locational decisions of firms which are found near Changi Airport so in that sense I'm asking about why they decide to locate at Changi
B,Has the factors in Changi attract them meaning uhm do the airport does the airport uh create a conducive environment for them to to to acquire their products overseas or to sell their products in overseas market
B,Uhm at the same time I'm looking at the spatial patterns uhm is there any special areas whereby these firms will locate
B,Are they being dictated by their own choices or by government something like that
B,Although my main concern is actually on the uhm growth pole I mean the airport has a growth centre in terms of natural forces meaning naturally you will develop because the airport is there and you attract the firms to that location
B,But I know definitely the government will play a very important role so I had to look into the qualitative issue rather than the quantitative issues
A,What do they think which are
B,Meaning that I got to conduct surveys interviews with the stat boards
A,And have you done so
B,Yes and it's not easy because they're not willing to talk that much
A,Is a is a not
B,Is a ya and they are not willing to disclose too many informations so that could be
B,Another problem which I face is not many of my surveyed form are returned so my sampling size are pretty small actually
A,Sampling size interview
B,Ya
A,So are you going to do anything about it because normally when you select the sample size right you'll take into account of representativeness whether the size if representative or where the issue that you're dealing with
A,So when you come across this problem of survey forms not returned there will definitely in a one way or another affect the representativeness
A,So what are you gonna to do with it
B,Okay I I agree in that area but thank goodness on my case is that the number of replied are quite equal meaning that I have the number of form which I wanted so I'm quite happy with it in that sense but I would prefer more you see
B,Usually like for example under one category only have one or two replied form instead of four or five ya so when it's one or two it would represent the whole you see so that is what I'm worried but as long as I'm able to get something is better than nothing
A,If when you do surveys is normally the case lah unless you do informal surveys over the telephone or doing a tape recording like this then you won't have the problem of surveys not coming back nah
B,The only problem is that you must get to allow you tape the voices to allow you for such interview
A,Basically a behavioural approach approach uhm mine is essential texture it's a post-modern challenge and geographical approach
A,Uh basically I'll be looking at the heminetical aspect that means in terms of uh interpreting language
A,The text here shall refer to the newspapers lah that of my main source of information for it
A,Uhm I'll be looking at environmental issues as contain in the newspaper uh time series analysis of four years
B,Why environment is is there any other
A,It's geographical in a sense because the approach is looking at text the newspapers as text and it's geographical because we are looking at environment
B,Okay
A,Ya how how the media especially the the Malay newspapers has been instrumental in in so-called instilling a sense of environmental awareness amongst the community lah
A,So that that is so you can call it a hypothesis so so to say uhm in terms of environmental awareness among the Malay community
A,Why did <unclear> word </unclear> the role of media has been positive positive or otherwise
A,So basically that's it lah and the research thing has been going rather slow and it's brilliant
B,It's takes quite a lot of time ya
A,Because you're dealing with not one or two newspapers what you're dealing with four years you know four years and that's three hundred and sixty-five times four
A,Over such a short period of few months and having a lot of other things to do I wish I could have done more lah in the sense because there are other areas that is worth looking lah in terms of what let's say production of production and consumption of environmental meanings because right now uh what I'm dealing with is under consumption part how the the the readers specially the Malay community so called decode uh interpret the what is written in the newspapers lah
A,I'm not dealing much on the con production side ya
A,Production is a a more intricate thing you got you got to know who are the writers
B,Why they want
A,Ah their intent intention all this so
A,Edmund is dealing with the production side because he's dealing more towards the the the production of comics
A,Uh so but he has a so-called access to the interviews written by others on the with respect to the authors lah the the comic writers lah
A,So maybe he can use that as a as a basis of uhm ya the production side so I don't have access because nobody has interviewed any of the journalists and
B,Why don't you try and interview them
B,I mean wouldn't that be easily maybe you can
A,Ya I tried I'm I'm going to interview them only after I have establish my
B,Okay your record
A,Yes my research findings because without the research findings you go there and you tried to interview you don't have that you know yes
A,Because if you have the research findings when you go there it's like your have the thing back in your mind and when they say something which is
B,Not correct
A,ah contrary to your research findings it's much easier for you to so-called you know highlight the thing but on the other hand ya if you don't have the research findings in place before prior to the interview then it's quite difficult
B,What else *Interruption* </I>
A,I'm quite interested about the P S C lah especially on the education service but uh my main thrust is to ask them what is because uhm lately there has been calls for increasing teachers' pay so but the details has has not been made known to public so maybe I I hope they can ya that's right
A,But I don't think they will tell me everything lah in details but what I suppose is that they will not exactly touch on the starting pay but more on the increment yearly increment nah because the Civil Service yearly in increment is very little can say is very little
B,Well for my case I won't be interested of any of these simply because I'm already bonded so uhm there's no room for me to look other career until or unless somebody can bail me out of this trap
A,Ah ha but you have to pay uh
B,Ya you got
A,If you want to break the bond you have to pay
B,Yes I have to pay the whole lump sum
A,I think it's about thirty to forty thousand
B,Or maybe more I don't know
A,Ya
B,I can't I I don't bother actually because I thought that uhm since they already I mean since I have this scholarship and they already ensured me a job
A,It's a six year scholarship
B,Yes it's a six six years bond
B,Well if you were to continue teaching I mean if you intend to teach right so we might in the same line because my scholarship is actually teaching
A,Teaching scholarship lah
B,Yes
A,Do you know the starting starting pay
B,Well I'm not very sure
B,I guess it's about two thousand
A,Two thousand odd
B,For guys because of the N S thing lah yes
A,But during the the course at N I E will be about one thousand three right and I mean ya one thousand three hundred
B,Well about it
A,And I've been looking through the past years in terms of this uh grant you know I mean teaching grant or teaching bursary whatever they call it
A,It has been static static at three one thousand three hundred you know whereas the general degree uh student-teachers their teaching bursary has been
B,Raised
A,Ya has been raised over the years ya but this uh Honours for for the Honours student the the the teaching bursary has not been disturbed at all
A,So it has been rather static at one thousand three hundred <X>
A,So what what do you think this one thousand three hundred
A,Do you think it's enough
B,Well actually uhm maybe not now maybe later when the time comes I guess the problem will be there
B,I really don't because presently you don't need the money so and you I guess you won't feel the difference but unless during that time when you start to be involved in the whole programme and you need the money then you starts to voice out again
B,So normally you just tackle the problem when the problems come lah
A,Do you think uh the education service has done uh done their part in terms of retaining the the talented the best in terms of uh teachers
B,Well if you were to look at my case most of my lect tutors in J Cs they have left
B,Ya in fact they are all quite good simply because other places or rather the private sides are paying them more than what the teaching line are doing so I guess one of the method is the pay
B,Another one would definitely be the extra things which you will have to be involve especially E C As uhm maybe setting out some funny programmes uh schemes uhm camp especially
A,Camp
B,Ya some some are involve in like you know English camps in video camps
B,What have you
A,So to make the career more ex exciting in a sense lah
B,Ya
A,But what what do you think of
A,Okay so far the the
B,I guess the problem is the burden they have
B,If the principal is able to get uhm some other extra personnels to dealt with to
B,I mean to to
A,To deal with the
B,To to to deal with this
A,Administrative
B,nNt only administrative matters but maybe the E C As you know like you know like maybe for instance to talk about N P C C maybe can get some of those people who are more involve in N P C C to to to become guidence or counsellor rather than rather than to get the locals </X> </I>
