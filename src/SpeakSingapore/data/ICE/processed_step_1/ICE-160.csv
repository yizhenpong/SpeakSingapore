A,Item number two Mr Charles Charles Chong
B,Uh Mr Chairman Sir
B,I beg to move the sum to be allocated for Head I be reduced by ten dollars in respect of Code I A fifteen hundred of the main estimates
B,Sir I note the Minister for Communications on the twentieth of February this year released figures to indicate that our sea-port is the world's number one three times over
B,The figures announced by the Minister showed that the PAS was the world's number one container port
B,and according to the Minister Singapore is also number one in terms of gross registered shipping tonnage
B,and yet again number one in terms of the number of vessel movements
B,Uh Sir we just heard the Minister remind the House a few moments ago that Changi airport is also number one in the world
B,I would like to ask the Minister how important or necessary is our current obsession with the number one position
B,Uh Sir I do not think many Singaporeans would dispute the fact that in order to survive and to prosper we need to constantly strive to be better
B,However this obsession with the number one position in some cases may be completely unnecessary
B,For example being number one for rules regulations and fines is definitely unnecessary
B,In other cases being number one may just not be good enough
B,Now although the Singapore worker's been rated number one in the world for more than a decade it does not mean that we have arrived
B,In fact there are still many areas that must be improved as pointed by by an honourable friend Dr Ow Ching Hock a few days ago in this House
B,Now Sir if in striving to be the best we can be takes us to the top position should we not enjoy being number one in the world a little more modestly and quietly
B,Now blowing our own trumpet whenever any survey no matter how in insignificant it rates us as being number one in the world may not have very many beneficial effects
B,It may mistakenly convey the impression on our people that we are already the best that we can be
B,However more significantly it may make us more prominent targets for protectionist measures taken by the less competitive and the more envious who may perceive us to be bigger competitors than what we actually are
B,Now perhaps the Minister could give us his views on this subject
B,Uh Mr Chairman Sir with your kind permission could I now take my second cut
B,However before speaking on Singapore's air services agreements I would like to declare my special interest in this subject as an employee of Singapore airlines
B,Sir in the re in recently concluded air services agreements with other countries we appear to be giving away more liberal traffic rights to other carriers than what we receive for Singapore carriers
B,It also appears that despite this very liberal air policy Singapore's carriers still face apparent protectionist measures taken by other countries
B,Now could the Minister comment this issue and let us know what advantage our liberal air policy has on air carriers in Singapore and also on the country as a whole
B,Sir I beg to move
A,The question is that the sum to be allocated for H I to be reduced by ten dollars in respect of Code 1 A fifteen hundred of the main estimates
A,Mr Mah
A,Sorry Mr Harun Ghani
A,You can take both cuts
C,Okay thank you
C,When Telecom introduced new pricing system for charging usage of telephone our level of society felt that the action caused inconvenience to public
C,Sir your Ministry of Communications became a target for this unhappiness
C,However through the survey conducted in December ninety one received seventy three percent of the users would bear lesser than before
C,This relieved the public and less unhappiness heard
C,Sir indirectly Telecom has succeed into getting the public to be thirsty
C,My compliments to Minister of Telecommunications
C,Further to this I would like to know the information pertaining to the public usage of telephone in months of January and February this year
C,If it is invariable with the finding in December and feedback received than the public will more relieved
C,Sir time-based price system indirectly may reduce the profit or may not be profitable to Telecom
C,Therefore how Telecom to reconcile reduction in revenue earned with expansion planned by employing high-technology
C,Sir it seem that there is one more point which cause unhappiness to factory employees who are using office telephones
C,Those who work in factory will not be allowed uh able to use office telephone
C,It would be better if Telecom provide card telephone in factory office so that it can be used by the employees
C,I raise this point because there are factories which want to install card telephone but was rejected by Telecom
C,Second cut Sir
C,Permission
C,This year Telecom is entering privatization and definitely it will provide big program which requires high-technology equipment and services
C,Beside large amount of investment required services of skill level will also play an important role in the excellent services provide by Telecom
C,In view of this will the employee be given skilled training or whether they have been trained and ready to excel in providing such services in future
C,What about those who are not able to adjust themselves to rapid expansion of Telecom especially long service employees
C,Either their services are no longer required or they've been transferred to do tasks which different from their usual job
C,and if their services are no longer required what sort of compensation will Telecom provide for them
C,Sir Telecom intention to sell share to public as uh I think the the DPM already mentioned will not uh uh the idea
C,Indeed it's appropriate move and shall be commended
C,My sincere is dead his employee should be given priority in purchasing the share through CPF saving or as to boost the morale of the employees
C,I'm saying this not because my wife is working with Telecom
C,It is just coincidence
C,For those who do not have CPF saving this is the time for them to start saving and learn to be for the future and old age
C,Sir my hope my hope is that if Telecom want to reap large profit through privatization and increase capital expenditure on high technology and equipment the burden of bearing the high cost should not be shifted to consumers only
C,Thank you Sir
A,Mr Mah
D,Mr Chairman Sir Mr Charles Chong asked why we are so obsessed with always being the best in the world
D,Sir it is my fervent belief that we must maintain this obsession and I use the word obsession without apology
D,Sir maintaining a number one position for us is not an end in itself but a means to an end
D,If I can use our sea-port as an example why do we push and why do we strive to keep the port of Singapore a number one container port a number one port in terms of shipping and so on
D,Sir to remain the number one port is not just a matter of collecting accolades which all Singaporeans can be proud of
D,Sure we are proud to be the number one port in the world
D,But more importantly is that with this achievement comes not only pride but also very very tangible benefits
D,Economically the port creates jobs and it creates wealth for our people
D,There're seven thousand workers directly employed by the PAS there're another thirty eight thousand employed in industries which are related to the port
D,Last year or in nineteen ninety the PAS contributed something like two percent to the national wealth
D,And if we add the port-related industries warehousing ship- etcetera the contribution rises to something like three to four percent of the national wealth
D,So this is something like one quarter of the transport and communications sector's contribution to the national economy
D,So it's not just not not just a matter of being number one for its own sake but striving to be the best
D,And in the process finding that we are the best in the world we are number one in the world and trying to maintain that position
D,There is no reason for us to feel apologetic about it
D,I think if we can do it we should continue to try for it
D,But I have to add that this is not going to be plain-sailing
D,There're other ports that are coming up in the region
D,They are also believe it or not trying to number one
D,They've all upgraded their facilities in the last few years in terms of the kind of business that the port of Singapore carries out
D,We have to continue to make sure that we are more cost-competitive than them
D,We are more efficient and we provide the best supporting services
D,If we can continue to do this we will continue to remain as the number one port in the in the region and in the world and we continue to reap the benefits
D,Sir the government is aware that the PAS must have the necessary support particularly in the area of port capacity
D,We must be able to provide sufficient capacity to handle the amount of cargo that is to come our way
D,So PAS is now working closely with relevant government agencies to plan a new container port which will meet the needs of Singapore beyond the century and keep us as number one
D,Sir Mr Charles Chong also asked about our uh liberal open skies policy
D,I think it is a well-known fact that we have consistently adopted such a policy
D,Basically what it means is that while we negotiate air rights on a bilateral basis with different countries we want to have as many of these bilateral agreements as possible
D,Once such an agreement is concluded we allow the other countries airline to fly to Singapore even if our national carrier has no immediate plans to fly to that country
D,Now why do we do this
D,The reason is very simple
D,It brings us many benefits
D,It enhances tourism visitors from all parts of the world can get in and out of Singapore quickly and conveniently encourages investment it benefits trade and most of all consumers will benefit from a wider choice of airlines and more convenient itineraries
D,Now I sometimes like to think of our airport as a huge bus interchange with flights coming in and out at such frequent intervals that sometimes people would rather come to Singapore catch a flight and then go on to their final destination destination rather than go directly because it is faster and sometimes it's even cheaper to do it the this way
D,So while we continue to adopt this open skies policy I must mention the fact that it does not mean that Singapore is prepared to give away more than what we actually receive
D,And in this respect whenever we have an air services negotiation it is the overall package of exchange that must be an equitable one
D,and when I say equitable I'm talking about there being a balance of opportunities
D,Not a balance of benefit but a balance of opportunities for both sides
D,And the reason why we ask for a balance of opportunities is simply because we know that under such a situation we can compete with the best in the world
D,Sir I turn to Harun Ghani's points
D,I thank him for his concern that uh Singapore Telecom's profit will be reduced because of introduction of time-based charges
D,I he asked for some statistics latest statistics on telephone usage under the time-based charge
D,If I may present this Sir
D,In January nineteen ninety two that is uh January this year under the flat under the flat rate system
D,Sir sorry sixty nine percent of the people paid less under the time-based charge than under the flat rate system <X>
