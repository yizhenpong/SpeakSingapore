i,Management meeting </X>
A,Think this is the first time we have two generations in the same meeting
A,Uh we won't wait for uh Sheila so we can get started
A,I think Tan knows why uh he is here to capture the English used not the Chinese used
A,Uhm I must say first I will have to leave by one forty-five so I am going to run through a little bit faster then maybe some of you anything you all want to discuss together as a group
A,Uh first of all the sports can I leave you to look after that after I have left
A,Uh a number of things that come up uh over the past week huh
A,First of all the ranking of uh teachers huh I there is a new set of forms SAR forms that come out staff appraisal report forms
A,Uhm they are usual the usual thing are three types of forms is the uh the performance report <unclear> word </unclear> appraisal that's the potential and the third one is the work review
A,Same thing but all three are all three have been revamped right
A,Uh to me it looks more difficult but according to ministry it says it's simpler
A,Maybe it is because we are not familiar with the pattern format
A,Uhm but for this year just to let you know the ministry is changing the schedule somewhat all right
A,In the past years the uh the SAR forms everything <unclear> word </unclear> at the end of the year
A,And last year in February they asked us for the potential forms
A,They said the performance forms was only to be included
A,Teachers whose performance grade is D or below
A,So we only had two forms last year
A,Uh this year they have asked for the uh potential form to be done in May right
A,The performance form if is if at all is need to be done but they have not decided but if it should to be done it will be done at the end of the year
A,So performance form will come at the end of the year potential will be done at the end of May and the schedule will be out I will give you the detailed schedule at a nearer date but just basically uh to let you know ahead of time so that it won't come as a big shock
A,We need we need to do uh the teachers' ranking together with the remember we had a teachers' ranking session together with the uh inspectors
B,Yes
A,You remember
A,Uh last year I can't remember when we did it but it was definitely towards the end of the latter part of the year all right
A,Now this year the performance ranking will be done uh quite early
A,Let me just check my schedule for this year
A,Performance ranking I slotted the date for our school
A,We will be doing the ranking together with Brenda on the twentieth of May
A,So you may like to jot down the date on your diary twentieth of May right
A,It will probably start at two o'clock
A,I will confirm this and the exact time later on
A,So twentieth May which means to say that uh we will have to have our pre-ranking done very much earlier
A,Now ministry is supposed to have already sent me the pre-ranking form by yesterday
A,I have not seen any anything yet uh it could be with the courier service not arrive yet but uh the once it comes in and I get everything sorted out I will get this to you as quickly as as earliest possible so that you got time to <unclear> word </unclear>
A,My guess either I look at it because there is there is not the usual twelve month gap between one ranking and the next
A,The potential can't be changed very much all right
A,So uh I did bring this up to the ministry that if we rank potential then end of the year we rank uh performance 'cause performance is something else because a teacher's performance can change quite drastically over one year period
A,But I uh agree with them that the performance no the potential ranking cannot changed very much especially since the lapse is about half a year only
A,So uh I don't know whether you <unclear> word </unclear> but you probably did quite Okay with that Unless <unclear> word </unclear>
B,Twentieth May is for potential right
A,Potential
B,You call us to uh
C,Potential ranking
A,Potential ranking
A,We are only going to potential ranking
A,Performance ranking will be end of the year if uh it may not come with the form but the potential performance ranking definitely will be done at the end of the year all right
A,My uh the point that I brought up to the ministry is that there will be some difficulty since this is the first time we are doing performance and potential quite far apart
A,Because uh remember we said that uh for an officer to be to be ranked uh to be given a grade of sorry to be to be ranked on potential or given a potential of two grades higher
A,Let's say a teacher was given a uh grade P6B for instance from P grade to P6B cause P7 is HOD or SH LH P6B is VP right
A,OK so if a teacher is given a potential grade of P6B from P8 it's two grades higher Two grades higher the performance grade must be at least a B all right
A,Remember C is one grade up B is two grades up but now now that we are doing potential now and performance end of the year there may be cases of contradiction all right
A,So uh this is to be <unclear> word </unclear> in mind when we do the ranking all right
A,But uh we will do our pre-ranking this month later part of this month and then we try to do our internal ranking together
A,Uh of course inter-departmental ranking early next month in time for Brenda to come and do final ranking with us on the twentieth all right
A,The rational behind this maybe I just point out the rational behind this ministry is now thinking of doing appointments some time in the middle of the year all right
A,So if there should be any HODs appointed VPs or VPs appointed principals and so on their appointments for promotions and so on will become uh in this instance closer to the promotion date
A,Promotion date is now fixed as first of April
A,So appointments will be some time in June July as well so that's why we are doing this otherwise unlike in the past all the appointments come quite late at the end of the year
A,They are also trying to change appointments of all other appointees other than the principals somewhere in the course of the year probably closer to the end of the year because if there is a lot of new appointments at the end of the year then it can cause a lot of disruption to the whole system all right
A,So whether that's good system or not I think that is debatable but this is what they are going for all right
A,So uh cross ranking I have given you the date sorry ranking I have given you the date twentieth of uh
C,Mr Sim there will be another promotion exercise towards the later part
A,No from now on there is only one promotion exercise
C,But uh over yesterday's news they said that there is another promotion exercise
A,No
A,I think they are talking about appointments <unclear> word </unclear>
A,I think it is not to be mixed up appointments with promotions
A,From now on the appointments uh promotions will only be once a year
A,Okay uh that's done
A,Now cluster activities I have not asked you about this but uh in the email to me some time last month uh we have been asked whether we would like to take up cluster activities
A,Another words rather than organise things on our own we work as a cluster <unclear> word </unclear>
A,We save on organisational uh effort and also on cost all right
A,So at the moment two uh three items have crop up uh two concerning uh one concerning pupils and two concerning teachers
A,I just list it out and then you note it down and see whether you want to have this uh if you want to have this for your pupils then we will you let me know so that we can I can book this with them
A,All right one is pupil student leadership
A,Student leadership actually Charlton has got a consultant and this consultant is actually coming to see me tomorrow morning all right
A,Uh they are running a course two and a half day stay-in course on student leadership all right
A,And uh the cost is not a big problem I think cost because we group together the cost per head will be less all right
A,And uh at the moment we have uh fixed the date as twenty-fourth to twenty-sixth of June
A,Towards the latter part of the June holidays
A,Twenty-fourth to twenty-sixth is actually a Thursday to Saturday so two and a half days and Saturday being a half day all right
A,And they have also allocated a also arranged for the venue to be Ai Tong School
A,Ai Tong has got a quite large uh compound so we are using Ai Tong because it also got a lot of special rooms including the threatrette that can seat two hundred people <unclear> word </unclear>
C,Will it involve P6 pupils
A,Uh we have checked that
A,We will be remaining open but most of us felt that it should be P5 because P5 pupils June quite close to streaming exam
C,Ah that's right
B,P5 exam
A,So I think the target should be P5 P4 and P6 are out simply because it's too close to the exam
A,So it would be P5 pupils all right
A,So this is one
A,The other one is uh there was a course conducted by ministry of health on voice are for teachers
A,I think you all familiar with this kind of picture
A,Uh some of our teachers applied separate uh initially a lot of the Chinese teachers went through it and it was quite good
A,They found it helps
A,Uh we are asking whether the ministry of health the consultants can hold a course for our cluster because some of our teachers applied then turned down all right
A,And they told us that they are willing to conduct for a three hour session for one thousand dollars all right
A,Now teachers applied I think will have to pay uh
B,Twenty-five
B,Twenty
A,I think it's ten dollars
A,How much is that
B,Twenty
A,Twenty dollars per head so that means they are working on fifty people is it
A,All right
A,Uh they are telling us that uh one thousand dollars per session they are not bothered about how many people we can have
A,One thousand people then is one dollar each
A,So uh it just a session for them and we thought this would benefit us as a cluster
A,At the moment we have uh we said that you open up to all the cluster schools and if we have five hundred people each one pays only two dollars
A,But we will probably arrange at a venue that is a bit more conducive rather than the school so at the moment two venues have cropped up
A,One is either Serangoon Country Club or the grassroot club at Ang Mo Kio all right
A,They have got quite nice facilities and probably <unclear> word </unclear> if it's held in the afternoon then high tea all right uh all through me so this uh we have fixed the date as twenty-fifth June
A,Right the last Friday of the school holidays
A,So we will publicise this to our teachers and find out how many are interested uh can you can you like
A,So I will ask Nancy to publicise this </I>
