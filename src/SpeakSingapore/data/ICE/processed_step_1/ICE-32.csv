A,You still got a lot of time
B,Got lah got lah
A,If you don't do it now you won't do it later you know
B,I know
A,And I still find it very useful because the only person that still still maintains that contact uh
B,Uhm
A,<unclear> word </unclear> uh is only is only me uh me and Tze Peng that kind of uh
B,Uh uh
A,But Tze Peng one is still quite far
A,Tze Peng only contacts within <unclear> word </unclear> for two days you see

B,Ya I want to go after that
A,Huh but it must be a
B,<unclear> word </unclear> not more than three months you know
A,Huh ya but it must be a four month kind of a attachment otherwise
B,Ah yes
A,Otherwise you won't get to know the whole mechanics you know
B,Ya
B,I but he they when I talked to Jerry and the they didn't they didn't sound very keen uh
A,Maybe I talk to him again
B,No actually they say okay you know
B,It is good you know
B,But they they cautioned me in that I should not uh look at the administrative side of it so much
A,True ah true ah
B,Ya
A,But it is not the administrative
B,Ya more for uh my own experience uh
A,Ah it is actually for the work experience
B,Exposure
A,How you go about investigating a case
B,Uhm
A,Ya it is <unclear> word </unclear> that you can actually see a the whole area of factory
B,Ya
A,Which you will never get to see here
A,Moving out sub-factories <unclear> word </unclear> so it's actually very very narrow uh
A,The only ones that you see actually <unclear> word </unclear> on and off you get to see a few electronics factories and that is about it
B,Uhm
B,Unless I go myself lah
A,No you can't go <unclear> word </unclear> you see
B,Ya difficult lah
A,No you can't you can't just <unclear> word </unclear> you can't just <unclear> word </unclear> into the factory uh
B,Ya ya
B,Quite difficult lah
B,So I think I was thinking of starting in September October and November
A,Probably actually you may want to speak to Hock Siang and find out what is the best time to go uh
B,Ya he he
A,Because they have their peak periods and and down period
B,Ya
A,Uh the peak period meaning a lot of staff going on leave that kind of thing
B,Uhm
A,Get a chance to do more you see
B,Uhm
A,Because if you are there and everybody is there uh then you you won't have much you won't have much to do uh
B,Actually I have a <unclear> word </unclear> I I can take over
B,What is his name uh
B,That guy
A,Peter Tay
B,Ah Peter Tay while he is doing his full-time course uh
A,Ah ya he is starting what he is starting from July
B,Ya <unclear> word </unclear>
A,So June the whole month the whole
A,Practically the whole year
B,Oh
A,Uhm they will love your your presence to a certain extent
B,So what do they do there
B,Quite busy uh
A,No lah not too too bad
A,But you can investigate some of the case actually will be good
A,They probably will not allow you to investigate the whole case uh
A,But you can tag along you see
A,You can even go with Hock Siang or go with people like Siok Lin who won't mind showing you the ropes uh
B,That is the thing you see
B,If I go uh for because I talked to Hock Siang
B,He said it will take me at least one or two months right to be familiar to be able to be on my own uh
B,That is what that is how long Peter Tay took
A,Ya
B,Two three months right
A,But but
B,You won't say I won't be useful to them
B,That is the problem right
A,Uh certainly you won't be that useful lah
A,But one one of the thing that you can offer them is that you can try to help them out to upgrade their computer system
B,Aiyah <unclear> word </unclear>
A,And you are using D Base they use D Base
A,You are quite familiar right
B,Whoa I'm very familiar with D Base
A,Uh
A,Least familiar
B,Very very familiar
A,Ah that is that is very good what because
B,Uh
A,The only one that is helping them out now is this uh fifty something year old man who is retiring soon
B,Huh
B,Really
A,Ya
B,Okay lah
B,I don't mind I
A,You
B,Cos I am qualified because when I asked last spoke to Hock Siang in uh <unclear> word </unclear>
B,He said six months will be nice lah because six months will be a real help to them rather than uh uhm uhm might be just a burden to them
A,No but you won't be a burden uh if you if you just tag along you see
B,Ya lah
A,In all their visits that kind of thing
B,Ya true lah
A,Uh then at the during the times when you are free
A,If you can help them out on the computer system <X>
B,Uhm uhm
A,That side of the people will appreciate that because uh prior to this this guy uh Chee Lan uh somebody else did it for them
A,I mean this engineer you know and he spent most of this time just doing all these thing
A,And then he got so <unclear> word </unclear> he went he quit you know
A,He quit the job and went to do a Diploma in the in Artificial Intelligence
B,Is it
A,Ya
B,Oh
A,IISS
B,Oh
A,Ya graduated
A,And they have enough they have enough systems around what
B,Oh
A,you might like to try
B,Cos the other thing I have to plan my dissertation
