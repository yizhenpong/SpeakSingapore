A,<unclear> word </unclear> consultants they pay them quite a lot so I I hope will will get to be one lah
B,Ya I hope I hope
A,Ya so actually ya so she said see how lah
A,So consultants are the ones who actually do up the proposal you see
B,Uhm
A,and you know get the information and write up the stuff
A,So I think for her she just you know provides support lah
B,So she does the running about and gathering the information lah
A,Uhm I don't know about the running about
A,This is the first time I've heard her coming here to get information ya
B,Ah

A,Uhm
B,Then I said like so how's how how do how do you like the hairstyling you know
B,Very good
A,Uhm
B,She's very impressed but then I think like make-up she was like I don't know what she was looking for lah but actually like I mean what do you expect
B,Like miracles uh
B,I mean what do you expect
B,Like like those tsk you know those artists uh those Paris make-up artists uh
B,Like super-models uh
A,Ya those models uh ya
A,Ya I well I don't think the the photos do a lot of justice to the make-up lah but
B,Uhm
A,I think it's also very important to remember who who the models are you see I mean because they are like normal you know
B,Ordinary people
A,Ya ordinary people
A,You see so it's not like I mean not exactly like your Ah Lian Ah Hui that sort lah but you know
B,Ya but
B,Ya
A,Ya so and sometimes you can't expect miracles really
A,I mean of course you want to look good you know but uhm ya and then some of these people may not be photogenic
B,Ya that's right
A,You know so it doesn't come off
B,And you you don't have all those touch-ups and photography
A,Ya
A,Ah tell your sis if she wants uh
B,Ya
A,she can come over to my place
B,Uhm
A,and have a look at my Dayspring album
B,Ya ya ya okay
A,Ah because uh then you know to see if she wants before if she wants uh that sort of photographs before she signs up lah otherwise
B,Uhm uhm uhm
A,you know if it's not to her expectation then you know seven hundred and ninety dollars is a lot of money to spend for that
B,Ya
A,Then she can also see the make-up
A,I I really like Dayspring's uhm make-up artist did really
B,Catherine
A,uhm no no that one is uh Lancome
A,That one is separate
A,That one I got for the day
B,Orh
A,But uh the studio one because mine was a whole package and nuh it was together with studio make-up as well
B,Eh uh uh uh
A,So the lady did it very nicely
A,I was like whoa can't even recognise myself
B,Uhm
A,Ya
B,Ya I saw I saw
A,<unclear> word </unclear> turned out
A,I think the photos turned out quite quite good lah
B,Ya ya
A,So uhm ya if she wants to you can ask her lah <unclear> word </unclear>
B,In fact I think I think your photos you look very good in your photographs
A,Ya I mean in the studio photo I take uh
A,Huh
B,Yes yes yes yes
A,Not like myself like that
A,So like whoa okay
B,Ya enhanced lah enhanced lah
A,Remember <unclear> word </unclear>
A,Ya but Hans oh oh enhanced
B,Enhanced
B,Hans like ya Hans
A,Like goldfish eyes
A,He can't get over it
A,So like so sad because he's really the photogenic one you know
A,I'm the one who's not
A,So I say oh you got no problem lah you know
A,So when the photos turned out it's like why am I like staring like that
A,So I've to find excuses you know
A,No lah maybe sleepy that day no maybe headache lah
B,Maybe he should have looked into a flower <unclear> word </unclear> looking
A,Ya he's <unclear> word </unclear> disappointed but I mean I still think he looks good
B,Ya
A,Because he's really very photogenic
A,When you take him un unawares uh
B,Ya
A,He comes out very nicely
B,Uhm uhm
A,for some reason or other
B,Ya
A,That's why I told you lah when I pin up his hair
A,Quite good
B,Some some people it it's it's like this you know whether the camera likes you or not
A,ya
B,Ya
A,Some it's like turns out really good and also I think it depends on the photographer's skill and the kind of background
B,Uhm
A,Like uhm there was once I I wore this red dress
B,Uhm uhm uhm uhm
A,to go to this friend's wedding so she took photographer like
B,Uhm
A,I looked normal lah you know goggy
B,Uhm
A,And all that When I went to take then the same day that afternoon
B,Uhm uhm
A,I went to take uhm a passport photograph and uhm my IC photo <unclear> word </unclear>
B,Ya ya oh ya you're telling me
B,Very nice
A,Ya then like ya quite good
A,So I thought ya I suppose it depends on who's taking it as well as
B,Ya
A,The kind of uhm background that you have then
A,Ya lah a lot of factors
B,Ya
A,whether it's outside indoors or outdoors so all that Burn must bear in mind lah
B,Ya
A,I mean she can look really wonderful for studio and she may look really wonderful on that day but the photos may not turn out that well you see
B,Ya I think so you know
B,That's true
A,Ya so just tell her to be realistic and wake up you know
B,Ya lah that that's it like she must she must do her research all lah
A,Ya
B,I guess she's a
A,Because she's not so too keen on on Jokim
B,No she she she wants she she's gonna ya she she's not too like wow about his make-up but she she's going to take him on and
A,Oh she's going to take him on nuh
B,If if since he agrees to take her on so okay lor
A,Uh okay fine
A,Like Jo quite funny uh
A,Like he just decides okay six hundred dollars
B,Maybe he's been calculating you know in his mind
A,Ya
A,No actu I I don't know lah I think based on what I know of Jo he will like look at you and and the person and he thinks that
B,He can afford it
A,He can work with you and ya I mean <unclear> word </unclear> your budget lah
B,Uh
A,and then of and then he will like talk to you and then if he thinks he likes working with you then okay you know he doesn't mind
A,The money is not that important
B,Ah
A,But let's say if you know he doesn't really like you very much
B,Uh
A,and he thinks you're very calculative and all that sort of thing
B,Uh
A,he doesn't really click with you then I don't think he will give you the the discount
B,Oh
A,I think that's how he works
A,I mean I I haven't told him this lah but I've been observing him you see
B,Aah
A,So
B,But he's mighty generous
A,Ya he's he's quite fun lah I mean he will do do that for the sake of friendship or for the sake of you know ya
B,Ya
A,of feelings lah you know you qing that type of thing
B,Orh
A,Ya yau qeng
B,because ya ya oh because like ya when he when I first met him I thought like he like quite business-like
B,I thought
A,Ya but then later on he like kind of warmed up lah
B,Ya and became himself and showed us his topper
B,I like was very shocked like he really went to the room and take out stuff and like showed us like eh
A,Ya ya
B,I like <unclear> word </unclear> oh maybe Theresa and him are
A,In and all right
A,Ya
B,like maybe like you know very good friends
A,Ya mean like he's never done that lah
A,Normally we are quite sane
B,I mean how long
B,Ya quite good friends you know
B,I think you all share a lot right
B,Must be on Christian stuff uh
A,Ah ya I mean we just we just talk lah you know and he's like quite strange because there are some things that he knows and there are some things that he doesn't know like siblings he thought was like you know sons and daughters <X>
B,That's children
A,<unclear> word </unclear> sisters ya
B,He's so cute
A,Or something like that lah you know Ah like when you say psychosomatic <unclear> word </unclear> uh like what you know But I I like that about him because he's very frank you know and he doesn't like uhm ya put on airs <unclear> word </unclear>
B,Ya un unpretentious lah
A,Ya he's quite unpretentious so ya that that's why it's fun and I always enjoy my my sessions with him Even like now when I call him I'm quite scared because it's like what you feel you know like he's a bit stand-offish
B,Ya
A,Even when I call him it's like uh Jo I want to cut my hair then he like uhm okay let me see and then he like we never joke and we never like talk properly over the phone you know
B,Ya ya
A,It's just like a business transaction then uh when I <unclear> word </unclear>
B,That was how my sis ya ya
A,ya it's only when I see him then okay you know I will like oh talk to him lah then he'll be okay Ya so he's that sort lah
B,because <unclear> word </unclear> like oh hello then wasn't like very
A,friendly sort
B,Ya ya like oh no
A,He doesn't warm up to you <unclear> word </unclear>
B,ya he doesn't then I like oh no maybe I was rude somewhere I like
A,Ya I know I feel that all the time
B,Huh
A,It's like maybe I was imposing on him or like sometimes when I go down at five minutes late or whatever
A,It's like I feel so terrible you know
B,Ya
A,then like oh nev' mind it's okay okay I mean then he started <unclear> word </unclear> / sounded <unclear> word </unclear> so so you know
