A,Good evening and welcome to Points of View
A,Tonight we talk about divorce why it's on the rise in Singapore and how we can make it less traumatic
A,But first I have someone with me who's been through a divorce
A,Rosaline you've been divorced eighteen years
B,That's right
A,Could you tell us what were the circumstances which led up to your divorce
B,And I wish I could say many good things about my husband but he was a very violent man
B,I was very much tortured by physical violence and he was an unreasonable man
B,Each time I would talk to him uhm I just ended up being beaten up and uh the last straw was when he committed adultery
B,I could not take it any more
A,Thank you Rosaline
A,Well Rosaline isn't alone
A,She's one of a growing number of people who are divorced and according to the latest figures ten couples get divorced every day
A,That's twice the number ten years ago
A,A common reason suggested is that more women are working now and their husbands are no longer <unclear> word </unclear> so divorce becomes an easy option
A,But is that the main reason for the increasing divorce rate or is the situation more complex than that
A,To discuss this and other issues I have with me an audience of social workers sociologists lawyers and people who are divorced
A,Mr Kenneth Chen MP for Hong Kah GRC is also joining us for the discussion
A,Mr Chen by the way is happily married with two children
A,But first let's get back uh get back to you Rosaline
B,Uh
A,Uh now at the time of the your divorce were you working now
B,Yes I've always been working
A,Now had you not been working at the time would it have been as easy for you to go through with the divorce
B,If I had not been working I would have given it a second thought I would do it for the sake of my children
B,Even though it would mean that I wouldn't have much quality life uhm as that something that you know if I had to depend on my husband totally then definitely it would have been it wouldn't have been easy to go through this
A,Okay uh Rosaline has just told us uhm that uh the fact that she was working at the time made it easier for her to go through the divorce
A,Mr Yeo is that uhm one of the reasons why divorce is on the increase in Singapore with more women working today
C,I think it is a bit too naive uh to isolate one factor as contributing to divorce uh
C,I think there are uhm various factors
C,So to just say that it's because a woman have uh economic power that leads to divorce I think that helps them have power in their decision-making because we don't want to cast the woman in a very powerless position <unclear> word </unclear> this situation
C,Certainly they helps them make a decision
A,So what are the factors then you think today that act uh that has caused this increase in divorce rates
C,I can think of a number of factors uh from my counselling experience with the couples have marital problems and those who are considering divorce
C,I think one obvious factor is a fact that uh marriage as it stands I mean is not a very easy relationship to maintain
C,Uh we often take a romantic idea that you know if two persons are happy in marriage then they can live happily ever after
C,I think that is a myth and we must realise that it is not easy to live intimately with another person for a long period of time
C,The other reality I suppose is that when we have any kind of change in society you're bound to have all kinds of pressures on this type of relationship and when people change they have options they have other ways of looking at things
C,Then they may also not become very tolerant when they live together and I think that also contributes to a part of the decision-making
A,Uh Nirmala uh Mr Yeo mentioned the that people have this romantic view towards marriage and uh sometimes it's not fulfilled this romantic side of view that they have
A,Would you agree with that
D,Yes to some extent
D,Uh again it I I agree with him that uh one can't just look for one single cause
D,But if you look at marriages today it's quite different from marriage as before
D,There is a great deal more stress and strain for husbands and wives because uh previously for example what a woman wants of her husband is to play the breadwinner role and in fact that becomes crucial especially when women do not work
D,There is a heavy material dependence and in a sense when you go out to work the material dependence is lessened
D,It gives women more power and I think that this power that they do derive through working is important because they have the choice of getting out of a bad marriage and I and I firmly support that
A,But with its uh the higher educational level of of women today uh is that a contributing factor to divorce other other other expectations changing as a result of their their higher education
D,I think the expectations are changing because one now looks uh uh for in a marriage one looks for a husband to also share in a marriage I mean their notions of sharing of intimacy with the social intimacy sexual intimacy uh uhm and you must remember that previously when people married the children arrived earlier
D,Now with Family Planning and also we own HDB flats so uh people now uh don't live in extended families any more
D,So the nucleus of relation has become has sort of focused upon more and more upon the husband and wife and they need and there's great deal more demands on each other to deliver certain emotional goods which previously could be delivered through other kinds of relationships
A,Uh Doc Doctor Neo
E,Yes uhm I would like to add that when we look at the educational level of woman and attribute that to be one of the main reasons for increasing divorce it's misleading because then it assumes that uh don't educate the woman and therefore divorce rate will go down
E,I think education is just one of the means for woman as well as for man to be having a better understanding perhaps about what marriage is
E,But unfortunately uh we don't seem to find that uh many adults when they want to get married they're not sure whether the reasons why they want to get into a marriage situation is very clearly established
E,So it has to do with partly expectations because it goes back to the fact that we don't have the right kind of education and awareness to prepare individuals to have life-long commitment with each other
E,So I I will not you know easily and and over-generalizing this say that it is just a fact that women are more educated now and therefore it leads to you know more divorces
E,I think this is where we tend to over-focus on woman uh and I I increasingly feel that uh the problem could also lie with the fact that we men have not been able to keep up with the progress of women and that adds additional strain to the situation as well you see <unclear> word </unclear>
E,<unclear> word </unclear> because they they want equal partnership just not that uh uh husband brings money and that's it the end of the relationship
C,And the men can't take that sometimes you see so
D,Ya
C,In a sense I think you want to balance up
C,Then we have to also equally uh look at the men and see how they are not able to cope with that kind of a change of expectations so they are they are fixed with their own expectations
A,Would you agree that uh people today you think are getting married at uh an age when they are not ready to get married Mr Chen
F,I don't think this is the problem uh al although statistics shows that the marriage group getting break up break up uh broken up lies quite a lot on the twenty five to thirty five group
F,I think the correct way to assess this is uh by percentage because those who married later uh in re uh in comparison to those who married earlier is much less in number first and uh and those who have married for five years compared to those who have married for ten years the the ten uh those who married for ten year has more resilience to marriage than five years
F,So I think uh I wouldn't place too much notice on uh age as a factor
A,But if we look at the uh the uh demands upon society on individuals uh these days with more and more men and women out working uh do you think they rush into marriage too soon with uh you know what with trying to to uh stabilise their career and the bringing up uh bring up children and uh looking after wife at the same time or a husband Mr Mr Yeo
C,I think that is true when we look at the the divorce rate falling within that age range
C,I think that is a very stressful part of an adult's life you know and if we look at those who are graduates even more so because they've just come into the world of work and then you add that to other expectation from having to try and own a home and try to build your career build your marriage have children we're loading them with a lot of things you know
C,And and I don't know if we if we should not take a careful look at the <unclear> word </unclear>
C,Can we slow that down a little bit rather than try and push people but of course then we get another problem you see people then marry later and later we have another set of problem
A,<unclear> word </unclear> you were married in an early age and you're divorced now
A,Now how did the how did that affect your uh your marriage your career and your family
A,Were you able to reconcile the two <unclear> word </unclear>
A,Now you know marriage usually not always it is the man that is more likely to step of line a wee bit out of line whereas it is the woman who is the one who got a repeat and nag and nag
A,Perhaps nagging is a too strong a word but will tend to repeat and repeat
A,Therefore if the man were to step a bit out of line the woman should pretend that she didn't see it and when the woman nag that man should pretend that he doesn't hear it
A,There you there you are you got a perfect marriage <unclear> word </unclear>
A,No I I would I would I would disagree with Melvin because in my case uhm I used to try and talk it with my husband and he was beyond talking and uh finally I gave up talking to him because I saw the futility of talking to him and he didn't only step a little bit of out of line
A,He went out of line totally many times he wouldn't come back
A,The times he came back he was a total stranger and then we would have arguments again and there was very one bad incident there that happened that he wanted to hit me and and I was happy because the father the mother the whole family saw what kind of husband I was living with
A,So it's not true what he said you know you stop nagging and the man don't do anything
A,In my husband's case no not nothing was going to stop him so I stop and I I I told myself it's no use talking to him <X>
A,Okay now you were a divorcee you're a divorcee as well
A,Uhm can you relate with to uh Rosaline's situation <unclear> word </unclear> Well not really because I think uh you know for <unclear> word </unclear> and myself it was a very amicable kind of divorce You know and I think uh what we both had in mind really was the welfare of the children It was now how do we un try and get them to cope with this very new situation <unclear> word </unclear> : I think for me I have two very uh wonderful parents who are very supportive an elder sister who is uh you know she's not married but you know she's got all the maternal instincts and by far and large she's the one who uh was the disciplinarian you know when I was trying to work through my own grief <unclear> word </unclear> : Uh but that lead to the other point you were raising earlier uhm whether uhm it is the age the marrying age uhm people are marrying younger whether that is a contributing factor but I guess it's not just the age it's what is expected out of a person after marriage like can you go on as a person individual going through achieving your ambition can you go through a career or studies for that matter I mean whatever that is important that is contributing factor because if uh individual life stops uh at the point of marriage then really the age is not uh important I guess but expectations of society and ourselves
A,So what what's the secret recipe then for healthy marriage uh Mrs Hia you've been married uh for quite some time Now what's the secret to your success Mrs Hia: Well I think we there are uh several ingredients I can think of I won't say it's just one secret Uh not least of all I think uhm it's the fact that we share common values I think Uh there is a common reference point some things we would accept as being right and acceptable and others not Uh that's one and uh also a commitment to say that we will make it work This is the end there there is no option
