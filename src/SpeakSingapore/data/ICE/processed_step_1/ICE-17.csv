A,<unclear> word </unclear> I want you to tell me how much to change
A,Okay but have you decided roughly what <unclear> word </unclear> amount
A,I don't know how much you want
B,What is the estimate
B,Have you all decided or not
A,Have not decided
B,Because eight hundred you all were saying for the food and the no for accommodation and entrance fees right
A,Ya
B,But then
C,You got the breakdown or not
B,Maybe you can ask uh Beng what is the best best op
A,Do you know how much currency we need to bring
B,How much are you estimating for food let's say per meal
D,I don't know
D,Just bringing two thousand dollars
B,Oh two thousand uh
D,Ya Then from there <unclear> word </unclear>
B,But how much are you going to change for each country
B,Five hundred
D,When I go there then I know what
B,Oh you're just bringing all cheques is it
D,Ya <unclear> word </unclear> owes me two hundred and forty six dollars
B,But it's not in currency
C,Ya
D,Ha
B,So Beng how how much do you think we should estimate per meals
C,Forty twenty forty for accommodation twenty
B,Per day
B,But our accommodation is all fostered in right now
B,In your latest
D,Ya but I don't see I don't think you should count it that way
D,What I gave you was an estimate
D,I mean are you going to take take all the money out and then separate out this is uh what moving money and that is <unclear> word </unclear>
B,That means right
B,So your two thousand includes what you have costed in your itinerary plus food and souvenirs
D,Ya ya the whole thing
B,So that is about what we have calculated
n,
B,Two thousand
B,So which means it's correct
B,You see it's about five hundred to <unclear> word </unclear>
A,FIve hundred per country is it
B,Ya
B,So if you go by her estimate in the write-up then that one each country is about two hundred fifty
B,So we left about two hundred fifty for our own food and souvenirs
B,Then if want to bring some more cheques hor
C,We only have four countries so <unclear> word </unclear>
B,Two thousand uh
C,Ya it's enough
B,So that's why we were intending to ask him to
A,<unclear> word </unclear> can you pass me your cash cheque

A,You don't know whether I'll lose it or not
C,Two hundred and fifty
A,Just in case
B,Anyway we are we are sharing you know

C,Two thousand
B,For two currencies
A,What you mean you are sharing
B,She's going to hold two countries' currency
B,I'm going to hold two currencies
A,Oh
B,Then if you need
A,Is that better
B,Huh
B,I think just handling less currency that is all lah but
A,Oh
B,The amount of the amount spent is the same
A,So you're just going to contribute into the pool lah or something like that
B,Actually we're not even contributing
B,I'll just buy for
A,Ya lah ya lah
B,you know how much for the currency
B,Come back then <unclear> word </unclear> whatever
A,That's the receipt for Vicky

A,So can write me a cheque
A,Will it be
A,You have already
B,Okay I have the cheque here no but the amount is not specified
C,<unclear> word </unclear> calculator
B,Anybody got calculator
A,I think I have I have a calculator
C,Do you know the exchange rates
A,No I don't know the exchange rates
C,Exactly speaking
B,Roughly
C,Then based on this one right
C,Student
B,Ya roughly
A,But usually <unclear> word </unclear> Sing dollar two thousand and then I'll change it for you five hundred per currency
B,Ya
A,or what
B,But that means you will have very loose change right
B,You may come up to the last cent and all that
C,Oh
A,Uh
B,I thought maybe we could do it the other way like five hundred guilders or five thousand guilders then how much Sing dollars per guilder <unclear> word </unclear>
A,But that means four hundred and something Sing dollars <unclear> word </unclear>
B,Ah
A,Oh
B,Isn't it easier
A,But the exchange you might not know the exchange rates or you can roughly <unclear> word </unclear>
B,Just a rough rough estimate
C,Or is it easier to say I want uh five hundred worth of five hundred Sing dollars worth of guilders
B,Ya
C,Then they just give you the amount
B,Right
B,So you have come up with a few cents all the loose <unclear> word </unclear>
C,Is it easier this way or you're going to change
A,But loose change is alright what
B,They might not have loose change
B,In fact then they might want <unclear> word </unclear> Sing dollars from you
C,Then they might ask you to buy less Sing dollar uh
B,Ya lor
A,Doesn't matter lor
C,Ya lah but roughly you would say okay about five hundred for this currency
A,But maximum two thousand right
C,Ya
B,Because if we if we calculate now we can roughly gauge like the closest to five hundred
C,Like okay Amsterdam is what ah
B,This is already three zero one
C,This is one currency right
B,Ya
C,Okay
C,This is about two seventy you know three about two seven something
C,Uh 'A' but this per person right
B,Per person
B,Okay
C,So if two persons you need three
B,'A' how does it work
A,There the numbers are here
B,Oh okay
B,Three zero zero
B,Where is zero
A,Here here
C,Where's on and off
B,Three zero zero times aiyuh so confusing looking at the alphabets
A,Wrong already
C,Wrong already
B,Three zero
A,Hey I'm going to bring this along you know
C,Ya I think this is useful
B,Three zero one
A,Are you sure
A,You can use point five
B,Point aiyah multiply okay about six zero <unclear> word </unclear> for food right
A,Point two
A,Why multiply by two
A,Oh I see I see
B,Two person
B,Two person will be six hundred and three
A,Okay
B,Time three
A,Uhm then times point nine
A,Oh no for food only
C,Ya this is only for food
B,Aiyah don't need don't need
B,I'll just do it in Singapore's Singapore currency uh
A,Ya then
B,Ya okay two seven two seven one
C,Two seven one point three nine
A,Three nine
C,One <unclear> word </unclear> is
B,Two
A,Five <unclear> word </unclear> : T
A,Then my
B,Ya terrible it's too close it's too close
A,Aiyah come uh come uh
A,Two seven one point three five times two
B,times two
A,This and then so
B,Bring up to a thousand dollars uh the closest times times two again
C,Why times two again
B,Okay can you uhm oh
A,Minus one thousand
B,This okay this amount would be just
A,Why don't you just calculate one thousand
A,Then you times <unclear> word </unclear>
C,You might not have enough
B,No this one is just for accommodation and entrance fees right
A,Oh okay
A,Okay okay
B,We need for meals and for
C,So how
A,Ya ya ya
A,So this is times two then
B,You can times two again right
B,Only it's going to be another double of the amount of of
C,Accommodation
B,So got paper or not
B,Write down the
u,
A,That's a lot
C,Ha
C,Whatever name we <unclear> word </unclear>
B,Can write behind right
A,Three
C,How much of the
B,'A' this one is very rough you know
B,About this is about Sing
C,Ya
B,One zero eight five point four Sing dollars right
B,Then how do you convert to guilders
C,Eight five point
A,Divide by
B,Multiply by
A,Divide by 0 nine
A,About there lor
B,Thousand two 0
A,one two zero six guilders
B,So either you can get one two 0 0 guilders or just a round up figure or a thousand guilders
A,But I can't tell you how much they have you know
B,Huh
A,Only they will know how much they have right
A,Small change
B,No need
B,That means you give me a round figure one thousand guilders
C,But she cannot get all big notes right
A,I don't know I don't know what they have
C,You must try and get
B,Oh it doesn't matter
B,Ya lor it it could be
C,Ya lah in <unclear> word </unclear>
B,ten smaller <unclear> word </unclear>
A,Okay
C,But it's not not too much small ones uh
A,Okay okay
B,Actually small ones also okay
A,Actually small ones are <unclear> word </unclear> okay what
C,No but too much of it uh you can imagine how much you're going to carry inside
B,Can we get one thousand two hundred guilders
A,Two tens how much in Sing dollars
B,One thousand two hundred
A,One two zero zero divide uh <unclear> word </unclear> point point nine
C,Dutch <unclear> word </unclear> right
B,Thousand eight
A,One zero eight zero Sing dollars
C,Huh
C,One zero eight
B,No this one is small
B,You know we want to round up to this uh
B,So it's one zero eight zero zero
B,Just an estimate you know
