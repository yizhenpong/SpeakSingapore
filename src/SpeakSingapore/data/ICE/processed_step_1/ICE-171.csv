A,May may I uh you see actually we we are a Canadian firm but we have a joint venture with the Overseas Union Bank group here
A,Alright and uh whatever you do buy from us if you do buy from us uh is valid internationally
A,Should you and your husband migrate or choose to work overseas uh this plan is internationally valid
A,And uh should something politically happen to Singapore you can still claim your money outside Singapore alright
A,Now you at the moment uh you you are married but you don't have any kids yet huh
A,Okay
A,Now there are some reasons why I ask that question
A,Now this firstly this is a covering letter and this ex explains all the concepts of our program here
A,Now one what is very unusual about this plan is the parent-child option
A,If you for example next year if you choose to start a family now when your son reaches eighteen or twenty-one assuming you have a boy it can be a girl but I'll just say boy
A,If if your son reaches eighteen or twenty-one if you don't want your plan you can transfer it to your child
A,So when your child you transfer it to your child it's like a legacy that you pass to your child
A,So your child at twenty-one will inherit your plan if you so wish to transfer to him but he will pay the rate of a small baby based on the year he was born
A,So that's a tremendous cost-saving you see and it is also without evidence of insurability
A,Now without evidence of insurability means that even if your child is born healthy but later on he develops a medical problem he can inherit your plan you see
A,Now this uh rider is given free to you and none of our competitors have got this feature here
A,Now the other feature that we have is the disability part
A,Uh uh I believe your husband is also with the varsity here
A,Okay
A,Now uh whatever occupation you're doing now if by injury or accident or disease due to sickness you can't do your current occupation we will pay you the full sum insured over five years
A,If you buy from our competitors it's over ten years and you must be like a complete vegetable you see
A,So this is the two different criterias
A,Uh now I'll I'll just explain to you the quantitative features then it's more easy for you you see
A,What I've covered is just the uh just the brief concept
A,Now this is a covering letter
A,These are the brochures
A,Now this is the uh core program
A,Now the core program is the actual program itself
A,Then hooked on the onto the actual programs are the riders
A,Riders are external features which are hooked onto the pro program you see
A,So this is the one that parent-child option which is given free to you
A,You can pass it to your first-born kid alright
A,Uh this is lifeline
A,Now lifeline is medical rider
A,Now uh if a person is infected with any of this disease a heart attack stroke invasive cancer invasive cancer means any cancer that is growing can be any part of the body kidney failure organ transplant multiple sclerosis viral hepatitis and heart disease requiring surgery
A,Then the the money will be paid one of below
A,There's no restriction on how you use your money you see
A,Now uh now so assuming that now let's say if you buy just hundred twenty thousand uh your annual premium annual when I say annual I mean it's paid on a uh on an annual basis it's one five six three point nine
A,But you can also pay through a monthly giro
A,Monthly giro means that the premium is deducted on a monthly basis from your bank account you see and that is only one three eight point zero nine which is not very much actually and that covers your hundred twenty thousand
A,Now what does it cover
A,You're covered against any form of death whether by external disease for hundred twenty thousand
A,Should that occur we pay hundred and twenty thousand to you
A,Now if you become disabled disabled can be due to many reasons uh it can be due to disease or injury or accident you know disease for example a heart attack stroke things like that uh you and you cannot do your current occupation which is that of a teacher lect uh researcher then we will pay the hundred and twenty thousand to you over five years
A,So you get twenty percent every year for five years
A,If you buy from any of our competitors they will pay you ten percent per year for ten years and you have to be totally disabled like a vegetable
A,Uh so now that is the disability part and if you should get any of the diseases here we will pay you fifty thousand
A,We will pay fifty thousand one off
A,How what we what you do with the money is your wish
A,There's no restriction you see
A,Now under this plan Mrs uh Lee you only pay for thirteen years after that it is given free to you
A,The program becomes self-financing after thirteen years
A,In other words after thirteen years you don't have to pay for the program if you choose not to but the coverage still goes on you see
A,Now uh assuming of course you want to give up the plan
A,So let's take it as one possible scenario at the age of sixty-five
A,If you choose to give up your program at at sixty-five I think that's a good age because chances are the government may raise the retirement age to sixty-five you see
A,So if you give that up you get back sixty-one thousand and thirty-six dollars
A,Now what you need to do is not to look at the absolute figure but take the index ratio
A,Now what do you mean by index ratio
A,Is take the money that you'll get back divide by how much you have put in
A,In other words what you'll get back uh as a ratio of what you have input into the program
A,Now if you divide this by what you have put into the program is a return of three dollars that means for every dollar that you put in eventually you're getting like three dollars here okay
A,So three dollars
A,Now you must also note that you're only paying for thirteen years so take your current age plus thirteen that gives you forty-one
A,So that means from the age of forty-one you're not paying you're still covered alright
A,And at sixty-five when you give up you get back this
A,So in other words from forty-one to sixty-five you're enjoying free coverage
A,Now how much is that
A,Forty-five to sixty-five uh forty-one to sixty-five
A,That's about twenty-four years free coverage
A,So twenty-four times one six one three oh uh times one five six three that's the annual premium that is your opportunity cost saving you see
A,And uh if you were uh to get any disease listed here on diagnosis we will pay you fifty thousand straightaway but if you don't get the disease but just death or disability takes place we'll still pay this this amount here
A,So in other words this doubles up as an insurance you see an insurance which is paid to you one off on diagnosis of disease
A,But at the same time if you don't get a disease we will still pay you on death or disability
A,So there are two concepts here
A,One is a saving concept which you will you will get when you terminate the plan if nothing has happened and the other concept is the coverage concept which pays you on death or disability or on diagnosis of any disease here
A,I I'm going I hope it's clear clear to you
A,Now this is only a summary of this uh because I realise that you may not have much time
A,So usually when I'm dealing with professionals or business people uh I uh do uh summary for them you see
A,Now you can see this is the premium column
A,Now after thirteen years it's free
A,In other words you can see all zeros you're not paying
A,Now cash value is your surrender value that means the money which is returned to you when you voluntarily terminate the plan okay
A,So this is the sixty-five mark here which I told you
A,Now this is the policy here Mrs Mrs Lee policy here
A,This is your age summarised at five-year intervals
A,So you can see when you are sixty-five if you terminate you get back this
A,If you give up at seventy you get back this which is even more
A,So it acts also as an old age sav saving scheme for you but you must note that after forty-one you are not paying
A,Now this is the coverage on your life
A,So on death we pay this amount depending when the occurrence takes place
A,Now uh I mean of course nobody likes to talk about such things but we have to explain to you
A,So if the occurrence takes place on the tenth year then this amount is paid to you
A,But on disability we pay this amount over five years which I explain to you just now
A,On death whole amount is paid On disability over five years but on diagnosis of the disease is here fifty thousand is paid as an advance one off alright
A,Now this is one side of the story that means after fourteen years you're not paying
A,Now the other now this a medical part which is included here now the other side of the story is that after fourteen years you may be doing very well in your career whether here or somewhere else and you may choose to keep on paying so we give you two alternatives
A,After thirteen fourteen years you can go for free or you can keep on paying if you want to
A,Now if you keep on paying you must note the premium remains the same
A,There's no change uh but it is fully paid up at sixty-five
A,Now look at the annual premium column
A,This is a running total uh accumulative total of all the premiums you have paid
A,Now look at sixty-five and seventy
A,Can you see the figures are the same
A,There's no change
A,It means that it is fully paid up at sixty-five
A,So af after sixty-five even if you want to pay also we don't want to accept the money
A,But if you're still covered you know
A,Now so uh now this is your surrender value uh Mrs Lee you can see when you give up at sixty-five you get hundred forty thousand as compared to just now uh sixty-five you get sixty-one thousand you get hundred forty so it is more than double
A,Now of course if you keep on paying your interest grows faster
A,There's no doubt about that
A,So when you stop paying there's a slowdown of your growth rate of your bonuses and your interest
A,So you can see that at sixty-five when you terminate you get this
A,Now if you terminate at seventy you get hundred and eighty-six thousand
A,Now if you terminate at eighty it will be even more
A,Now this plan you stop paying at sixty-five
A,It's fully paid up you see why but the coverage will go until ninety nine years of age until such time as you don't want the plan and you terminate it
A,Then we'll pay you the cash surrender value
A,So under this plan or under most insurance plans there are two concepts
A,One is the cash surrender value that is a savings element and the other one is the coverage
A,There's always these two concepts you see
A,Now this is the death benefit uh so on the event of death we pay this amount <X>
A,How much You check off against the year here alright Now this is a policy year we run it from one to twenty This is a summary of your age at five-year intervals right Now it will go on until nineteen ninety but I stop at seventy because there's no place for the computer printout So this is what we pay on death ah in the event of diagnosis of disease fifty thousand is paid one off and uh on disability we pay over five years the full amount you see Now this is the medical part which is included there already Now this is the interesting part nuh the parent-child option which I was explaining to you I I do not know whether you're planning to start a family soon if I'm not right right Uh let's say you you have a kid now I I just run a hypothetical example alright Let's say you have a kid now uh uh a son you just born of course uh it doesn't mean that you must have a son now you can have a son two years from now you see and then you can register him under this rider which is given free to you if you buy the plan So when your son is eighty one if you transfer the plan to your son we will give you back twenty-six thousand alright Your son's coverage will start at hundred and twenty thousand but he is only paying this premium rate per month per year sorry per year Now this you can see is an extremely cheaf cheap rate of seven hundred and four dollars per year and that is twenty-one years from now Assuming hypothetically that you have a new-born son now but if you have a son two years from now the rate is even cheaper you see because your son is not born yet So the rate is seven o four per year alright and uh this money is given back to you This is his insurance this is his premium Now we can extrapolate uh into the into the future So let's say you have passed to your son at twenty-one when your son is sixty years of age uh if you terminate the plan you will get back he will get back two hundred eighty-five thousand and this coverage will be this amount here This is his coverage when he's sixty years of age We are now projecting into the future but all the time he's only paying this premium which is that of a small baby just born you see If I can just show you by a straight line graph uh you see let's call let's look at this This is premium rate and this is uh age huh So uh are you familiar with statistics Uh now as you get older and older Mrs Lee your premium rate will increase but once you have bought the plan the rate is fixed you see So it depends where you come on board you see alright Now the older you are of course the more expensive it is because we are more susceptible to diseases So assuming now your son when he's twenty-one you pass him the plan by right he should be paying this premium rate here alright of a twenty-one year old but actually what he's paying is this premium rate here of a newborn infant backdated to the year he was born you see that that is the whole concept you see but even if he your son is born healthy uh or your daughter is born healthy there is no guarantee that they will remain healthy until twenty-one you see So even along the way if they develop a medical problem at twenty-one they are guaranteed of this uh of this plan you you know what I'm trying to say Now basically this is the the plan that we have been selling quite a lot of it around here to to the to uh I've some of it in the law faculty you see Uh this is the summary alright this is a summary whereby you stop paying after fourteen years This one you have the option of paying till sixty-five you know after fourteen years you need not stop you can keep on paying till sixty-five then you follow this scenario here Then this is your covering letter and this is a brochure which explains a bit of what I have just told you the parent's option alright where you can pass it to your kid and uh I've also enclosed one plan for your husband in case he may be interested to have a talk </X> </I>
