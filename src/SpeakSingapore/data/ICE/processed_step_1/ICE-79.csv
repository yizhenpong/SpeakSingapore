And to make matters worse four days later I was sitting in the Physics Department area and that same professor came down and saw me He came up saying "" Ai come on <unclear> word <unclear> I really enjoy your paper"" This is the not an exam research paper we are asked to do "" I really enjoy your paper It's original It's the first paper that I read and..."" she didn't say explicitly but you one was thinking no other paper came close to it in terms of you know originality and thought Cos that module was basically just reading from somewhere processing and just reduplicating in their own words <unclear> word <unclear> But I felt so bad we don't have time to talk but only say "" Ei I'm sorry I <screwed> up your exam"" But in fact she is a good teacher I feel let let him down"
