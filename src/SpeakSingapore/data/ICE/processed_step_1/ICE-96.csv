B,You have the freedom to do what you want now
C,Now uh I agree uh
B,How were the reviews of the <unclear> word </unclear> so far
C,Okay lah so far
B,I enjoyed the show yesterday uh
C,Huh
B,I thought it was quite good yesterday
C,Ya okay lah
B,Ya
C,so far it's been positive because there are some people can't make the link
B,Orh orh orh
C,Ya
B,I don't know what the link is lah but I assume it was trying to show that if your foundation not strong in both cases you will collapse or something like that
C,Uhm that that that can also
B,Ya
C,And some you will have someone that is uh the strong will survive
B,Ya you know ya there are so many ya
C,<unclear> word </unclear> someone to link
B,I just want to see the parallel between the two situations lah
B,Ya a lot of people left without realising what happened
C,No but uhm what we actually we haven't yet experiment experimented as in asking people two days later
B,Uhm uhm
B,You need sometime for it to sink in
C,<unclear> word </unclear> Ya lah I told uh we I don't know yet
B,Ya
C,If they can come to a realization two days later
B,Ya
C,they can still find for me because
B,Ya
C,As you're watching it it's just <unclear> word </unclear>
B,Ya it may because you're too engrossed with the show right and everything else in it you know
C,Ya ya you still don't want them to make the analysis then
B,Correct ya
C,But I don't know you see
C,Actually it's basically what we're trying to put in of course is entrapment
B,Entrapment nuh
C,Ya because getting uh because we're thinking of re-staging it so what we want made clearer
B,Uhm
C,Could be the the you know that the trap lah because <unclear> word </unclear> physically trapped and uh Kim Kim is trapped by Singaporeanness
B,Oh I see <unclear> word </unclear>
C,<unclear> word </unclear> she got to pay for <unclear> word </unclear>
C,I got to go
C,I can't
C,The difficulty of letting go the
B,Ya
C,you know Alan breaking free going
B,Correct ya
C,Ranching going out of the house etcetera
C,All a lot of uh and the idea of uh uh death
B,Uhm
C,Father's death that traps her growth
C,The the the people death that <unclear> word </unclear>
B,Ya
C,Taxes lah in life in in living in Singapore also maybe nuh being trapped by your job uh and you can't <unclear> word </unclear>
B,Ya
B,You know actually I think the play itself has a lot to offer
B,I'm I'm glad you're you're planning to re-stage it lah
C,Ya
B,I think too many of these plays here get done once and then get shelved and not you know not done again nuh
C,Uhm
B,It's a pity Ya
C,So we must get the audience who can share
B,Uhm
C,After that we you know see how lah see how which part we want
B,Okay lah
C,More you know which part because you know the part where they they caught and Jean cried out then you know I will die then I can walk through <unclear> word </unclear>
B,Ya correct ya
C,You see and so tonight we're going to uh we're make we're making Jean say that earlier
B,Oh
C,because as the overlay takes place
B,Uhm uhm
C,Uh audience gets caught up with the effect rather than the content you see
B,I see
C,So we want to put that earlier uh slightly earlier
C,When the <unclear> word </unclear>
B,Ya correct
B,That line is often left I mean it loses its impact
C,Ya
B,Ya correct
C,So maybe it is not that the maybe it's a bit of the script a bit of the delivery
B,Uhm uhm uhm
C,so you <unclear> word </unclear> with testing the the script out
B,Ya I think this' the best time to test whatever you want to do right huh
B,Fairly experimental at the moment
C,Ya
B,Ya
C,<unclear> word </unclear>
B,But I like I like the show lah
B,I I thought it was quite well produced
C,Ya
B,<unclear> word </unclear> the effect
C,The first night my god the audience
B,I know
B,Wan Hui was telling me the audience were were they were laughing at every line
C,Tuesday was a more you know more intelligent audience
B,Ya
C,because they followed the play
B,Ah
C,The first night they even laughed at the Singlish
B,Oh god
C,<unclear> word </unclear> So they laughed at everything
B,Oh you had the whole of SBC people at the back what Friday Background Sunny Lim and all that

B,who are there
C,<unclear> word </unclear>
B,So they were impressed they did ya
C,Is it
B,Ya
C,What did we do
C,We didn't know about the feedback lah
B,Uh because some <unclear> word </unclear> I was walking out they were talking to me because they knew I was working
C,Oh
B,Ya with you
B,Ya <unclear> word </unclear> whether I knew inside info
C,Oh
B,Most of them didn't catch the parallel you know
C,Most of them didn't
B,Ya
B,They enjoyed the acting
C,Ya
B,They enjoyed the acting the enjoyed the performance as a whole but the parallels I mean they're intelligent to make correlations lah
B,But you know like never show whether that was what the playwright wanted to come across or director wanted to come across
B,So kind of like that lah
C,Never mind lah
B,Okay
