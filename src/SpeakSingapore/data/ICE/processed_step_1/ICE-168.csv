B,I don't remember
A,You did not get any interpreters to communicate with the patient in this case
B,Interpreter from
A,Any person to interpret to you so that you could communicate with the patient
B,If as you say they only speak Bangladeshi then no

A,All right
A,Doctor can you look at your medical report paragraph two A
A,Healing linear abrasions over right cheek and left cheek
A,Both consistent with the history given
A,Can you please tell the Court how old in your opinion were these injuries
B,How old were the injuries
A,Yes
B,It should be about a week
B,At least a week old
A,Witness if I suggest to you that these injuries were inflicted on twenty-second January nineteen eighty-eight between three A M to five A M
A,Would you agree with that
A,This would be eight days
A,About eight days before you examined the patient
B,It is possible
A,And would you confirm in this Court that these injuries two A were consistent with having been caused by scratching on the patient's face with the fingernails of another person
B,Yes
A,Doctor
A,What about the injuries listed as two B in your report
A,Abrasions over the epigastric region of the abdomen and left forearm consistent with blunt injuries
A,Yes
A,You told this Court they were consistent with injuries sustained by climbing coconut trees
A,Now would you agree with me these injuries in the region of the abdomen would be consistent with fisting on the patient's abdomen by a person
B,No
B,These are superficial abrasions on the skin injuries that you would sustain when you scrape your skin against a rough surface and not a fist
A,Doctor I am referring to two B abrasions over the epigastric region
B,Right yes
A,Now
A,Did you pay attention to the appearance of this patient
A,When he was brought to you how did he appear to you
A,In other words what was his state
A,Your Honour I am trying to ask the doctor whether she observed this patient
A,Was he looking normal or was he excited
A,He was brought to you and what was your observation of this patient when he was brought to you
B,I don't recall very clearly but I don't remember he was agitated
A,You don't recall but you don't remember
A,Can you see your treatment card
A,Is there any note made of this observation
B,That he was agitated or not
A,Whatever your observations were
B,His general condition was good
A,Doctor did you take his blood pressure
B,Blood pressure yes
B,It was one hundred and nine over sixty-three millimetres mercury
A,One hundred and nine over
B,Sixty-three
A,Is that normal
B,Yes
A,And what was his pulse rate like
A,Did you take it
B,Fifty-three per minute
A,And would you describe that as normal
B,Yes
A,Doctor
A,The average pulse rate is around seventy seventy two isn't it
B,That is just an average heart rate but it is a wide range from fifty to about one hundred depending on your emotional state on your physical fitness
B,For somebody who has been doing manual work I would assume his physical status to be pretty healthy and fit
B,Sportsmen have been known to have pulse rate of thirty to forty beats per minute
B,So fifty three beats per minute to me is normal
A,I have no further questions
C,Sir I have watched the cross-examination of my learned friend
C,And to the extent of the dialogue they had as to the difficulties in communication
C,I would wish to adopt that part of it
C,I would just like to put in a few more questions of my own
C,Doctor Pua my clients says he doesn't speak English
C,He has difficulty in communicating in English
B,Does he speak not even a word of English
B,Yes
C,Doctor Pua
C,Looking at this report
C,I would put it to you that you did not obtain history from my client
B,What do you mean
C,On the record that you have in page forty six
C,Can you have a look at page twenty
C,Sorry you are looking at a different report
B,Yes
C,That is the one who is my client
B,Yes
C,Now you examined him on the first of February eighty eight at eleven fifty seven hours
C,You put down there he claimed that his right index and middle fingers were bitten by the deceased on twenty first February eighty eight
B,Where did I get the history that his right index and middle fingers
C,That's right
B,It's from him
C,So whatever barriers you may have had in communication you managed to overcome and come to this conclusion
B,Yes
B,I can't remember how I got the history including that of the road traffic accident
C,Doctor Pua
C,You mentioned here that the fingers were bitten by the deceased
C,How did you know that the deceased was involved
B,The patient came with an accompanied form where he had to fill in
B,And there is a short little history there
C,Can you come to that please
C,Can you read out that short little history
C,Read out the whole thing
B,On the thirty first of January nineteen eighty-eight at about nine P M subject was arrested at number twenty-six Mandai Lake Road for an offence of murder which was committed on the twenty second of January nineteen eighty eight at Jalan Kampong Chantek
B,Please examine subject for old scars injuries and also any fresh injuries as he is about to give a statement to the police under the provisions of section one hundred and twenty two point six C P C
B,He claimed that his fingers were bitten by the deceased and also had a fall in injuring his knees
C,So in fact you were given a preview preliminary instructions
B,Brief details
B,Yes
C,And basically this was what you have there
B,Just this section
B,Yes
C,Doctor Pua Phua you were in the company of a person who was apparently a murderer and you were only with a nurse a lady nurse
C,You were conducting an examination on a person who was suspected of being a murderer and you were only in the company of a lady nurse
B,I only remember that there was a nurse because that is routine
B,I don't remember whether there were other people in the room
B,Whether it was a lady nurse
B,Oh I can't remember whether the nurse was a lady or a male
C,So sorry it was a presumption on my part
C,When I heard the word nurse I presumed a lady
C,In the examination that you made
C,If understand you correctly when you do the examination
C,You examine your patient from head to toe and he is naked
B,Correct
C,Would the exact procedure be adopted in my client's case
B,Yes
C,Coming to the injuries marked as two A and two B
C,These were consistent with being bitten about eight or ten days prior to your examination
B,Yes
C,And the injury two F
C,These are consistent with a traffic accident in Bangladesh in nineteen seventy-six
B,Yes
C,That would put them about twelve years old because you examined him in nineteen eighty-eight
B,Yes
C,Doctor Pua did you also observe whether your patient had any mobility in his right arm
C,Anything in your card or observation notes
B,Yes
B,I did note that his right deltoid muscle
B,This muscle over here is wasted
C,It is wasted
B,Yes
C,So there would be an absence of some strength in that arm
B,There would be some absence
B,Yes
C,Is dexterity also affected
B,Not fully because
B,Are you talking about
C,Like swinging for example
C,Like going bowling or climbing coconut trees or anything else
