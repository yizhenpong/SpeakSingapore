speaker,speech
A,Peck Chuan uh
B,Ya
A,So what's your comment about tomorrow's meeting
B,Tomorrow ah
B,Ah tomorrow we're having our staff meeting and I hope Dr Teo can uh let us know our future direction clearer
B,Because uhm I think we're thinking of moving into a lot of new areas but uhm we must have a clear direction and clear commitment from the management
B,Otherwise is a bit difficult for people like us at the bottom
A,So uhm is is the restructuring of the organisation affecting you anyway
B,Uhm ya talking about this restructuring
B,Actually I haven't gone through the the the whole structure what's it's going to be like
B,Because this morning I don't have time to read the thing and the last meeting I wasn't there
B,But from what I know is for our team uhm we won't be affected that much because you know next time when our our side merge with your your team
A,Ya
B,We're going to merge right
A,In July
B,Uhm and then I think some for our side our people uh will be mainly doing the the back back end work uh whereas talking to users would be more from your your side and I I <unclear> word </unclear>
A,You mean that kind of thing including the three major departments
B,Which three
A,Like Bursar's and so on
B,Ya ya ya
A,We'll be the frontline
B,Ya
A,For all all the <unclear> word </unclear>
B,I I I'm not so sure exactly how they're going to uh divide the work lah but from what I know it's uhm uhm people like Diane myself Shuefen
B,They all will be doing development work and then when users have problem they won't call us directly they will call I don't know who from your side would be but I think you're one of them uhm when the printer got problem they call you
A,You mean you mean normal problem
A,What I'm referring to is those uhm as I said uh the accounting system you know
B,Ya so if if there is any of uh any problems that belongs to say say a particular application ah they will still go to the frontline people and if those people cannot solve it then they will channel back to the back up people
A,Oh I see
B,So because uh if say right now uh if the user say our user the account user they they printer got problem they will still call us you know
A,Uhm uhm uhm
B,But next time this one should be solved by the <unclear> word </unclear>
A,What you mean is that uhm we'll sort of act as a buffer
B,Uh the interface uh
A,Solve the the minor minor problems we'll solve
A,But when it comes to a more the more specialised programmes we'll look you'll look into that
B,Ya I think for you guys uh I think you'll still be involved in some development work lah
B,But I think most of the time you're attending to user
A,I hope not because it's supposed to be twenty twenty per cent the most
B,Ha
A,Am I right
A,And uh I think we'll be also involved development work
B,Ah
A,For me is uh postgrad schools ya and that's already a lot of maintenance actually
B,You expect to get other project
A,Ya ya
A,In fact at the moment only one school is is having the the system running so there there are three more actually
A,Don't know when the
B,<unclear> word </unclear>
A,hopefully new
B,The S Q L D S thing that you're working on
A,Ha
A,What S Q L D S
B,I thought I thought I thought you have to do some S Q L work
A,Uhm you mean oh assessing to the database is it
B,Ah
A,Of course that is that's where all the records are stored
B,All these while you're working on this system lah
A,Yes yes but of course the system sort of like retrieve and manipulates the data in the database
A,By the way uh Weiying is supposed to back me up
B,Who
A,Weiying from your group
B,Weiyan uh
A,Ah Weiyan ya suppose to
A,She's suppose to uhm back me up
B,In this system uh
A,Ya which is a surprise to me
B,Since when
A,Ha
A,I mean it's going to start in July or so
B,Oh oh
A,So she's going to be my back up for this thing
B,Oh you're the main one
A,That's why I was wondering is is that what's considered as merging you know between the two groups that you know backing up each other that kind of thing
B,Funny thing her system
A,And I won't think of it as a front line
B,Her her her system of taking over then she go and assist
A,It's just like physically uh changing office now
A,Job wise also change
B,Because actually uh you know I'm also working on this exam mark entry system right
B,Actually this one is done by done by a staff quite sometime ago lah and then a William took over and now I was ask to look into it further and
A,Further you mean enhancement
B,Ya maybe got to rewrite the whole thing lah
A,Why
B,Because ah because we're facing a lot of problems
B,We our there are a lot of departments using it and then they're all over the campus
B,And then one once they call up complain that there's a problem
B,We can't solve it on the spot we have to go down so it takes a lot of our time
B,So we're trying to find out ways to cut down on all this travelling
A,Uhm uhm that means more or less cut down on maintenance lah
B,Ya ya especially ya this thing is only used during exam time lah so
A,Once
B,During this period
A,Once a year that sort of thing
B,Ya and uh and also for me during this period uh is the the account section
B,They're having their year-end closing so it's a lot of work at us at the same time
B,So this one got to look into it lah
B,I'm currently looking into ways to improve and uh cut down on the the travelling
A,Improving uh by adding on or changing the system or to cut completely new you know
A,language or whatever
B,Or I don't know my boss was saying look into client server solution pos
B,That's one possibility ah but I don't think uhm this justifies because this
A,It's too expensive
B,Is going to take up too much time
B,I rather you know during uh this period you can do a bit of walking around rather than <unclear> word </unclear>
A,<unclear> word </unclear> users uh
B,Ya <unclear> word </unclear> users than to spend a months to redevelop to whole thing
A,But then if you redevelop it'll be let me think in the long run it'll be beneficial to everyone
B,Yes ya but the thing is when you rewrite probably five years later you've got to revamp the whole thing again
B,So the thing is whether spending this six months is is worth or not for this next five months ah sorry five years and during these five years is not you're not using it everyday
B,You're only using it during the exam period
A,But then you must see that uhm how about personally for saying to think that is beneficial to you
A,I mean you'll be learning a lot of new things
B,Ya
A,I think you find it quite interesting uhm
B,Ya uh I was telling my boss lah to use it as a as a learning platform
B,That's very good because if you were to move into client server next time we need to start off with some simple project uhm
B,We need to start off with some prototypes so that we can iron out
B,We can avoid uhm committing some serious uhm mistakes in uh in the real system you see so this is a a a good application to start off with lah
B,So uhm but if you were to develop purely for saving time one then I think this is not the right approach ah probably adding or modifying the existing programme is better
B,Ah so so let's talk about more your work
A,My my work uh
A,Uh at the moment I'm I'm doing of maintenance work and looking into development of uh uh some of the subsystem in addition to this assistance system maintenance
A,And uhm it still requires a lot of enhancement
A,And uh it seems that the system I mean the department is very dynamic
A,They change things uh now and then you see with new subjects you see with new subjects and so on coming in
A,So that requires a lot of changes to the system and that keeps me very busy ya
B,And on top of that you still got to support what Word Perfect
A,Uhm those are normal uh user supports lah located a a couple faculties to take I mean to take care of all the secretaries and so on for the O A System and general PC problem
B,Actually uh actually is quite interesting and quite good to have exposure to to do some uhm PC work
B,Uh if it is just purely mainframe then it's quite boring at times
A,Uh quite true because mainframe seems that there are much more restrictions than PCs
B,Ya
A,And
B,Actually now I'm also I'm looking into some uhm uhm tax retrieval and document management system
A,Is it
B,Ya it's actually for the personnel department you know
B,They have a lot of minutes
B,They keep a lot of minutes for the Senate meetings
A,I think at the moment there is a existing uh system as what you describe uh
B,You mean used by the
A,Using status <unclear> word </unclear>
B,Oh
A,Do they consider that
A,No
B,No we have to look into alternative solution we're not
A,You mean exclusive of that
B,Ya ya ya uhm
A,I mean since it's already there
A,Why not to take a look at it and see whether it it you know it's useful for your department
B,I'm I'm not quite sure why we're not going to use that
B,Probably because the support for it has uh uh is not there anymore
B,I'm I'm not very sure
A,It's still there
B,Is it
A,I'm supporting it
B,No no no I mean vendor support
A,Oh vendor support hah uh ya
A,I'm not too sure about that
B,Maybe there's no more upgrade anymore or what
B,I'm not so sure
A,You mean it's a dead
B,Ya ya but it's working lah
B,Future enhancement
B,Probably there isn't any
A,Oh I see so you're looking into vendor <unclear> word </unclear> that is growing
B,We're looking into PC solutions
B,Is that a PC based or mainframe based
A,Mainframe
B,Ya we're looking more into the PC
A,But PC I thought you have uhm stoage limitations
B,Oh nowadays PC can support up to quite uhm
A,But talk about just
B,Large capacity
A,Personnel Department is okay
A,How about in future to use for other departments
B,Uhm no
A,Just
B,Actually even in Personnel also the requirement can be very very high because you're talking about storing uhm uhm all documents you know belonging to each staff belonging to student
B,So when you apply for a job and then your resume your application form everything this probably got to be stored electronically lah
B,So by scanning in as an image and uh uh storing on uhm secondary storage devise
A,Like what like what CD-Rom
B,Optical disc
A,Optical disc
B,Ya it's something called Optical Judebox and that stores many optical disks but then these are very very expensive
B,So currently we are just looking into it lah
A,So what's the chances how's the chance like
B,Uh with that like of budget we have I think it's quite difficult to get uh a a very sophisticated system lah
B,We're just looking into the <unclear> word </unclear> feasibility lah and not not the actual product yet
B,And also the user side has not identified exactly what should be <unclear> word </unclear> archive into into uh uh computerised system
B,So that's why I these days I have to call up a lot of vendor <X>
B,I got a lot of meeting go for a lot of seminars
A,Is for this purpose
B,Which is quite interesting lah
A,Oh oh oh I thought all the while is current server
B,Current server also
B,That one is looking into uh Oracle Database Diane and myself lah
A,I thought it's Informix
B,Previously we're looking at Informix and Oracle plus some hardware
B,But uhm you know there's this task force current server task force so they delegate the work lah
B,So actually we're not in the task force but I don't why I got this got to do this also
B,Diane and myself we got task to look into Oracle
B,Interesting
A,Uh seems like we have talked quite a lot already uh
A,I was thinking of uh we're talking about the just now you mentioned about uhm optical disk is it
A,There are other alternatives right other than optical disk
A,I think uhm there's this
B,What
A,Any other alternatives since you said it was expensive
B,Actually uhm if you talk about if optical disk has very very high storage capacity
B,If you talk about cost per bit ah per bit of storage ah optical Disk is definitely cheaper than other means like magnetic tapes uh or not uh sorry magnetic disc our our normal uhm hard disk uhm but
A,The initial cost is high
B,Yes
A,Uhm again in the long run is is
B,Cheaper actually ya because you can store a lot more
A,So it really depends on how much data you have lah
A,Whether you real it's really necessary to get
B,Correct
A,Optical disk
B,Ya so it's for for example uhm well government department for example our Inland Revenue you collect so many forms right
B,If you were to keep them you need a big warehouse so
A,And if it catch fire that's it
B,Ya ya and you cannot duplicate </X> </I>
