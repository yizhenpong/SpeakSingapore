For the provided conversation transcript, attach an appropriate tone for the Singlish particles:\nC: I think people will go out to vote if not for anything at least for Mr Goh\nC: I\'ve heard people saying I like Mr Goh I don\'t like the MP I don\'t know what to do but I\'d rather vote with Mr Goh than take a gamble you know\nA: Peter do you think in announcing a by-election in twelve to eighteen months Mr Goh has in fact undercut the strategy of the opposition <X>\nA: I don\'t think so because uh you know the uh the uh the the bas the basic strength of the SDP\'s tactic in saying look let\'s fight this by-election is still there you know whether whether it\'s by-election now or by-election one and a half years from now so it\'s a it\'s a good move on the SDP and uh it\'s a it\'s a very uh compelling argument so we come back to the point of performance of the candidates and the party\'s performance so government must show must I think make uh recognise that uh one big factor is the Fanner\'s concept that people now have you know and the fact that government has reformed today you know it\'s going to make that an e even more important factor that you got to appear to be fair I like to take up a point that Bilveer raise which is that uh the issues are very different this tim eI think he\'s right on that score the issues are different but it does not make the election easier precisely because more people in the constituencies will be able to take the view well if we have a few more opposition members in parliament what is so wrong with that uh that\'s going to be a factor in this coming elections I think the other point that many people will have to consider would what kind of manifestos are the opposition parties coming up with the concept of gracious society is in a way within the PAP\'s manifesto I think unless the opposition is not conscious So are you saying then there really aren\'t any clear differences between the manifestos of the opposition and the PAP Bet you PAP will disagree with that But i would I would tend to say that the PAP have been very successful in hijacking many of the opposition parties\' manifestos especially when it come to talking of uh the lower classes talking about the poorer people I think this caring compassionate society has been very successfully uh modelled on by Mr Goh and it\'s really I think going to deliver That\'s one I\'m coming to the by-election strategy I think people are confused you know you have not run your GE you\'re already talking about your by-election That\'s one I think Number two it was mainly to overcome two basic arguments one was the SDP call for treating it as a by-election Number two was the J.B.J. problem and the fact that he chose to address it people amy argue that eh ther\'s something in it you know you just can\'t dismiss it as a ploy a tactic and I think people are beginning to think seriously about it and that that maybe this is an afterthought rather than really something thought through and that may in fact hurt Mr Goh in th long run Do you see the issues changing over the next ten days of the campaign you know anything can happen from Nomination Day to Polling Day but uh that\'s a a gen a general truth I would argue but uh my sense said i would not feel that fundamental of a change I think there will be basically quite low-key unless the opposition is able to come on with something out of their head But Mr Goh has draw has drawn the ground rules in the sense by pitting himself as the centre of this arena so it will be about mr Goh this time but perhaps uh longer run the worry will be a about Mr Goh\'s political role within the neighbourhood in uh ASEAN and so on the opposition parties need to come out more strongly with uh manifestos in respect of where they want Singapore go in the future Well I think it\'s not a manifesto bad backward all you know because the positions have have already closed uh closed closed up the the the uh endorsement of of mr Goh and uh I think he has a lot of goodwill and a lot of people will vote for him but that would that could be uh negated to some extent by local issues like constituencies and how the uh the candidates uh look because the uh I think Singaporeans become more sophisticated now they they do not accept the argument that unless I have a the PAP has a bigger mandate in percentage terms is going to be bad for the country so it\'s not that black and white lah Now while though the local issues are important at this particular time in point somehow or another they have been made quite insignificant by the fact that there is a call and the call is where does Mr Goh stand not just now maybe in the next decade or so I think that\'s very pressing well the last election was described as a watershed election now if you had to describe this one in just one word what would you say Peter we\'ll start with you Turning point Legitimacy Mr Goh\'s election Thank you gentlemen for your views well tomorrow the hustings begin with political rallies and dialogue sessions the campaign will continue for nine days after which you decide who to give your vote to good night </X> </I>'}]"
