42,"A: I I don't think that
B: In other words I mean if there is a life before it is possible it may not be possible but I think <unclear> word </unclear> it's just a theory
B: But it is quite likely you know that there should be cleared <unclear> word </unclear> live <unclear> word </unclear> before if that explains why you know our Lord now
A: No I don't think so lah
B: Ya there it it explains what they cannot change Like for example you know our family

A: Ya
A: I suppose you mean you can hold to your own beliefs lah

A: opening shows ah
B: shows The Crying Game
A: Oh ya it is suppose to be you you saw it right
B: I saw it"
48,"A: Ya it is it's one it's one it's in the you cannot tell me the ending right
A: You are not supposed to tell me
A: Ya it will be kind to me
A: I got to see it eventually lah
B: You have to see it <unclear> word </unclear>
A: Ya the thing is that I don't which theatres though
A: It's kind of obscure places"
49,"B: You have to see it <unclear> word </unclear>
A: Ya the thing is that I don't which theatres though
A: It's kind of obscure places
B: No lah
B: There are all sorts of interesting twists to it
A: Uhm
B: You know it is like it is very British <unclear> word </unclear>"
50,"B: It is a British film
A: Oh Ai yoh my friend went to see it and she said it was very good also
A: They have you know you said it was very good so
B: Uh ah
A: Ya must go see it lah
B: I figured that we get movies like after two months uh after America has it
A: Ya"
51,"A: Oh Ai yoh my friend went to see it and she said it was very good also
A: They have you know you said it was very good so
B: Uh ah
A: Ya must go see it lah
B: I figured that we get movies like after two months uh after America has it
A: Ya
B: Uhm"
52,"A: Well it is better than those days when you used to get them about one year or two years later
B: Really
A: Remember those days it was like we get it so late
B: Ah right
A: Six seven about a year later we get the film
B: Oh
A: Ya but now it is almost quite quite close"
53,"A: For example uh the cha kway teow you go to the cha kway teow man you said one fifty he'll know it's uhm one fifty worth of cha kway teow but if you were to go out and say one fifty to any passerby uhm something will happen
D: I mean besides besides that uhm local and geographical variations uhm for words like uhm gas and petrol uhm is American but petrol is more towards Singapore so uhm if you use the word gas in Singapore people might think that if you wanna buy you wanna you know order a tank of gas for your kitchen stove or something
D: So different ideas behind the words and uhm like Gail was saying for the word home different people have different ideas or different values attached to it right
C: Because they experience uhm it differently I mean in the sense that for some people home would be uhm very good uh very happy comfortable sort of idea whereas to some other people it might mean uhm like uh a broken home where beatings and drunken well whatever ah you know that kind of thing ya so it depends on experiences also
B: Say opposition what what you want to say to their points so far
E: Uhm I think what Gail says contradicts what Shirley says because Gail says that uhm in the definition of code you exclude world but then according to Shirley uhm context would therefore include world so I think that's contradiction there and uhm
C: Ya but we are sup we are proposing this motion right which should that we are we define the motion as being a correspondents between form and meaning and we are saying that world is important also so that's why context's important"
54,"B: By all means
E: Okay uhm <O> laughter </O>
E: If we were to take necessary condition as p and sufficient condition as q so uhm we do it this way
E: So if p is necessary condition ah p is sufficient condition and q is necessary condition neither necessary nor sufficient will be not bracket p or q so this case is true only when both p and q is false
E: So uhm if you want to say that this statement is true you have to prove to us that it is not necessary as well as not sufficient
E: But what we are trying to say that is that we are we we we can prove either of this three cases
E: See we can prove that it is just necessary or you can prove that it is just sufficient or you can prove that it is both necessary and and and sufficient and ours case stands here okay"
55,"F: It all comes under the heading of language you see and as a result it comes under the heading of codes
F: That's how our definition comes about
B: Okay now if I may interject uh for a while I think this this debate is kind of a digressing a little bit from what you're supposed to be talking about
B: Ah this thing about the the code you talk about whether it includes the world or doesn't include the world
B: It's quite a <unclear> word </unclear> point really it's not a point worth debating because you're given this you know in your two zero three you're given this form meaning well thing right and your your well from your reading okay you read it you read that shared code is a system a system of signs right system of signs and what is a sign
B: A sign is a okay a sign is something which ties form and meaning right which is a you know the the classic Sausurrean definition of a sign where you
B: Now when the the word sign is used by the structural linguists you know from Sausure's time the way they use meaning there is not the same as this framework which you've been given two zero three this form meaning world this FMW thing"
56,"B: Now when the the word sign is used by the structural linguists you know from Sausure's time the way they use meaning there is not the same as this framework which you've been given two zero three this form meaning world this FMW thing
B: In fact this FMW thing okay this is just an incidental point which I'm just saying to you now
B: It's it's just an abstraction alright just a framework uh which Dr Ferris is using himself okay which I personally I don't believe in okay
B: The kind of semantics that I do ah ah this to me this is this is bullshit okay but for your purposes for exam purposes you know if you <O> laughter </O>
B: alright
B: So when we talk about meaning in terms of uh the linguistic sign or whatever sign uhm it does not necessarily refer to just this this M alone okay could refer to to your W as well
B: Because when we talk about meaning okay in the Sausurean sense it can be sense as well as reference alright"
57,"B: One letter can represent more than one sound ya
A: Okay for example
B: Like uhm uhm uhm car and uh treat and uh hit
C: Hate hat all using ah
A: The ah okay
C: <unclear> word </unclear>
A: Ser Suan any examples"
58,"A: Okay for example
B: Like uhm uhm uhm car and uh treat and uh hit
C: Hate hat all using ah
A: The ah okay
C: <unclear> word </unclear>
A: Ser Suan any examples
D: <unclear> word </unclear> Country aspect"
59,"A: Boon Leng
C: Uh I think in the past they they always think that language has everything to do with writing so they always consider that writing is a I mean a a bit I think they're trying to reverse the <unclear> word </unclear> slowly
C: I think it's an over-correction now
A: Ah what does what does over-correction mean
C: That means to say uh they they do correct these false notion to a to a very extreme degree
A: Okay so instead of saying that now we should raise the standard of ah speech to the standard of writing make them equal they actually make it even more important
A: So now they're saying the other way uh the other thing that writing should represent speech"
60,"C: I think it's an over-correction now
A: Ah what does what does over-correction mean
C: That means to say uh they they do correct these false notion to a to a very extreme degree
A: Okay so instead of saying that now we should raise the standard of ah speech to the standard of writing make them equal they actually make it even more important
A: So now they're saying the other way uh the other thing that writing should represent speech
C: Ya
A: Okay what other explanations so you have besides over-correction"
61,"A: So now they're saying the other way uh the other thing that writing should represent speech
C: Ya
A: Okay what other explanations so you have besides over-correction
C: Uh they also because in the last in the past when they uh when they were learning how to read and write they they were using uhm I mean the students actually have to pronounce the word so for them uhm the words I mean ah they equate them with uh <unclear> word </unclear>
C: So uh but because the the kind of education uh system that we have nowadays is that we just look at the word and the word forms a mental impression on our heads so because the system is different I should think that uhm whoever is uh formulating this assumption must have got it from his ah learning experiences
A: Uhm uhm okay so the old habits of reading and writing affected their view of what spelling should be
A: Then one more thing about maybe they saw a very close connection between writing and speech and therefore they assume that it must be exactly the same"
62,"C: Ya
A: Okay what other explanations so you have besides over-correction
C: Uh they also because in the last in the past when they uh when they were learning how to read and write they they were using uhm I mean the students actually have to pronounce the word so for them uhm the words I mean ah they equate them with uh <unclear> word </unclear>
C: So uh but because the the kind of education uh system that we have nowadays is that we just look at the word and the word forms a mental impression on our heads so because the system is different I should think that uhm whoever is uh formulating this assumption must have got it from his ah learning experiences
A: Uhm uhm okay so the old habits of reading and writing affected their view of what spelling should be
A: Then one more thing about maybe they saw a very close connection between writing and speech and therefore they assume that it must be exactly the same
A: What sort of close connection do they see between writing and speech"
63,"A: So if we think that such views are wrong how do you think you can express the relationship better the relationship between speech and writing
E: Under true functions
A: Sorry
E: They've close connection but ah they have speech and writing as different functions and they occur in different contact
A: Right so can you give examples of that different functions etcetra
E: Uh speech has uhm paralinguistic function but uh writing doesn't have
A: For example"
64,"A: For example
A: What do you mean
A: Paralinguistic features
E: Uhm their gestures their facial expressions ah but you cannot uhm put that into writing
A: Okay that's one
A: What else
A: Choon Kiat"
65,"A: Once you borrow you do you spell it your own way or do you spell it their way
D: They anglicise it
D: It's not the the their own way modified their spelling
A: Ah Latin words
A: Okay what about French words like beauty cigarette
A: When you see the 'ette' you know immediately it's not English it's French right do you <o> laughs </O>
A: Intuitively maybe hopefully anyway so what about that"
66,"A: Okay so there are different explanations for etymological spellings
A: What about phonological
A: How did that start
F: Uhm are you referring to ah older words which were words which were spelt in a way which was pronounced in the past like for example I think psychology was the p-s was was pronounced in the past right
F: Was it
A: Was it
F: Was it somebody words"
67,"F: Was it somebody words
F: <O> laughs </O>
A: What's the point then if that is the case
F: I believe it's not to confuse people right like you ah it's been around for so long
A: Oh so you don't eliminate the p
B: But what I thought about phonological is like to reflect an image of sound
A: Ya"
68,"A: Can you see
A: Is it too light is it
A: Can you see from behind
A: You can't ah
A: Would it help if I turn off the light right
B: Right
A: So we have first of all the nitration of furan the nitration of furan uhm nitration is carried out using what is this reagent uhm Ee Lee"
69,"A: But for the rest you find that if this is S alright or if it is N-H alright thiophen or pyrrole actually these two alternatives also exist that means it can go like that or by this way
A: But you find that this pathway hardly takes place at all because the activation energy for loss of proton is very small and why is it small
A: It's because aromatic character is well developed in the final product alright so it never even looks at this pathway it is directed along this direction in this direction
A: So because of this ah for furan you do not have a straightforward substitution alright of H like N-O-2 but there is an addition by the acetate and ion to give rise to the two five adduct alright which is not stable so you do get back the product that uh one sets out to obtain the two nitrofuran by treatment of heat alright or uh by heat treatment or treatment with pyridine alright that will eliminate the acetate and give rise to the product okay
A: Right so that's for the nitration of furan
A: Now there could be other reagents used in place of acetyl nitrate uh reagents which contain a nitronium cat-ion and which are also weakly acidic
A: One example is nitronium etrafluoroborate this alright nitronium tetrafluoroborate"
70,"A:  You're going to lose your place in the queue and there's no point saying I've got a legal mortgage it is valid therefore I have a power of sale but you're number ten
A:  By the time you come to exercise the power of sale there's nothing to sell right
A:  So you want to be first in line you register
B:  <unclear> word </unclear> being a legal mortgage ah doesn't it rank you ahead of the rest already
A:  Yes no because if you don't register you don't have priorities so the fact that you are legal mortgage doesn't matter now because the RODA changes your rights of priority section four basically and section fourteen of the RODA okay
A:  Section section four says you must register section fourteen says once you register you are preserving your priority
A:  Consequently if you don't register you don't preserve your priority"
71,"A:  That's two e and therefore two f is basically the same answer
A:  The unregistered mortgage it doesn't matter whether you are legal or equitable in this case once you're unregistered you do not have priority
A:  Of course the registered legal mortgage will take priority
A:  One small little refinement to this point if the unregistered mortgage is an equitable mortgage you can't you can't register it at all under LTA and since you can't register it there is no fight because here we've got a interest that is unregisterable versus an interest which is registerable and between these two then the the ah equitable mortgagee must lodge a caveat to preserve his priority
A:  If he doesn't lodge a caveat I would think he remains outside the register and therefore he has no right at all
A:  Now in this case you would want to note the difference between the RODA system and the LTA
A:  Remember I said that under the RODA whether you are equitable or you're legal you are both registerable"
72,"B:  Sir when you lodge a caveat right does he rank uh ahead of the legal mortgage <X>
A:  Well the caveat is a sort of notice to the world
A:  Re remember if you remember your fixed charge lectures your first charge is a floating charge
A:  A second charge comes along and it's a fixed charge Now the fixed charge prevails over the floating charge you jump the queue if you're a fixed charge but if you are a fixed charge with notice of a negative pledge cross up here then you take with notice and therefore you take subject to that floating charge interest right Same thing here you've got an equitable mortgage caveated notice to all subsequent people that I've got an equitable mortgage then a legal legal mortgage comes along it's registered but it's registered subject to that interest because there is notice either actual or constructive okay Right Further questions Okay no further questions we move on to our letters of credit and firts question you are now employed by this bank very progressive bank It wants to entertain the customers' wish If you can solve the problems that the requests ah raise So now we want to discuss these problems and see whether it can accede to the customers' requests Okay so Mr Big your customer first request electronic communication facilities for credit Can you accede to that request Would you Are there any problems Mr Big just wants communication facilites to apply for credits to notify his beneficiary to notify himself that his credit has been opened basically that Can you do it Yes No Yes or no S2: Yes
A:  Yes Who says no Anyone thinks you won't request uh you won't accede to the request So you think yes All of you think yes Are there no problems then What problems do you think there might be in this case Any problem Okay the technical problems we're not going to discuss them here but anyway this is not a problem because technology exists to allow the customer to communicate with this bank by electronic communications right So it exists The modem is quite cheap the telephone is quite cheap your fax machine all these things are on fact quite common So it's not the question of technology Is there a legal problem Is there a legal problem here What sort what sort of problem do you have here if you think there is a problem Anyone </X> </I>"
73,"A: Now K-L is the mass transfer coefficient in the liquid phase
A: Now sometime we use the word film on top of it partly to identify that this relates to a special phase itself to phase one to phase two so usually we says film mass transfer coefficient
A: Later on you know why we have to use the word film to differentiate from what we call the overall mass transfer coefficient <X>
A: Now this is no different from your heat transfer lecture given by Dr Neo right We have our individual film transfer coefficient and later on we have our overall film transfer coefficent Now this diagram here illustrate the equilibrium relationship between the two phases relating to this particular solute A and this eq the equilibrium curve this arbitrary it can be described by a given equilibrium relationship If it is described by Henry's Law then that is not a <unclear> word </unclear> relationship it is a linear relationship okay Now here we can see that at the interface the composition is represented on the equilibrium curve and if you look at this the slope of this line joining the P-A-G and C-A-L that particular point in other word it describe the bulk concentration to the interface composition That slope is given by minus K-L over K-G It's a ratio of the two mass transfer coefficient Now this are not dimensionless ah The slope is not dimensionless because K-L and K-G has different dimension depending on how you what is the concentration uh composition you are using Here we are using partial pressure and molar concentration Now if you change both of this relationship to molar composition then it is dimensionless otherwise it is not okay </X> </I>"
74,"D: Uhm
A: Are you still reading that one
B: No I just I need the three act the acting one
A: Uhm you should read the other one lah
B: Uhm
A: Which I'm sure your have read
B: Uhm"
75,"A: Anything
A: And and how would you do it yah
C: For acting's approach got to oh you know what <unclear> word </unclear> all is
A: Ah okay that that could be a problem or okay that that see that's a problem which will not exist for uh would never have existed under <unclear> word </unclear> 's approach
A: But now exists under Atkins' approach
A: And the problem is even if you were to say that okay that that's the first first difficulty right framing of issue of question
A: Let's go on to the next one"
76,"A: You think the amendment makes it more consistent with our object and purpose of section five
B: It it qualifies the law to be applied to that restricted to mercantile law only
A: Okay fine
A: Any other problem on this section ah in in the old uh in the amend pre-amendment cases
A: Don't don't look at the <unclear> word </unclear> okay
A: Look at the cases first
A: Ask yourself okay what were all the problems that exist"
77,"B: They are very special municipal ways of legislating the region creating creating procedure and machinery and setting up restrictions and sanctions which are quite impossible to Christian ideas
A: Okay let's let's just stop there
A: Do you think that they're very special municipal ways of provision creating procedure and machinery setting up restrictions and sections penalty uh
A: Ah impossible application okay
A: Now ask yourself carefully is this is he talking generally about ah acts suitable or not suitable or is he saying that if an act creates for procedure and machinery and sets up restrictions and sanctions restrictions can be probably licensing and sanctions will be penalty
A: Are his remarks directed at a general applicability test or he's talking about a specific <unclear> word </unclear>
B: Moneylender's Act"
78,"A: Okay let's let's just stop there

B: Moneylender's Act
A: No not so much moneylender's act"
79,"A: So was the employer vicariously liable for his carelessness here
A: The answer was no
A: The employee's duties had ended right
A: The court used the phrase that ah that employee had gone on a frolic of his own
A: This word <unclear> word </unclear> sample phrases that I'm confident will end up in your vocabulary before very long
A: Just like phrases like floodgates of liability and very often been misused
A: But that really is a phrase which gets used from time to time when we're talking about the employee's duties yah"

A: You know Phuket is not a cheap place lah
A: Phuket itself is not a cheap place to get
C: Huh
C: It's not a cheap place"
111,"B: Ya I heard it's because they have to import the goods right from Bangkok itself
B: I mean they are selling
A: They are selling imported goods is it
C: So actually Bangkok is cheaper lah
A: Ya
B: Bangkok itself is very cheap
B: I tell you if you ask Ee Lan about that she will tell you about <unclear> word </unclear> vigorously"
112,"C: Really
C: Cheap in terms of what
C: In terms of like shopping
B: Ya lah
B: Things are very cheap
B: She bought so much for Christmas last year
C: Ha"
113,"C: Want to go Bangkok
C: I'm
B: But one thing Bangkok is very congested
C: Ya lah that's true
B: Pollution
C: I think I think Phuket is good for you know like just sit in the sun on the beach
B: The beach"
114,"C: <unclear> word </unclear> Beach
C: But then uh <unclear> word </unclear> Beach got a lot of those Ang Mo Lang leh
B: So
C: I mean I've been there and then it's nice lah
C: You know like nice sand nice white sand you know very fine
C: The sand is very fine and then the water uh you know it's it's not like Singapore beach you know
C: You walk for a short while and then <unclear> word </unclear> you know it's like so deep already"
115,"C: Theirs uh that that the beach uh the sand nuh stretch for miles and miles you know
B: It's very nice ya
C: It's very nice you know you just lie down there and then you can wear sort of like bikini you know
B: Ah really
A: My goodness
A: Wah you become so open when you are there
C: No lah I mean I don't have the figure for bikini"
116,"B: Ah really
A: My goodness
A: Wah you become so open when you are there
C: No lah I mean I don't have the figure for bikini
C: I mean I'm saying you can
B: Because she won't she won't meet anybody else except us
C: No"
117,"B: Because she won't she won't meet anybody else except us
C: No
C: I'm saying you can if you want to
C: Of course I don't have the figure for it lah
C: But
B: You don't have to have the figure to wear bikini do you
C: Huh"
118,"C: ya
B: Oh dear
C: I don't know
C: I mean so ya lah
C: I mean it's nice lah
C: I I would say
B: So how"
119,"B: Oh dear
C: I don't know
C: I mean so ya lah
C: I mean it's nice lah
C: I I would say
B: So how
C: Just to laze around"
120,"C: You're not keen uh
B: You know why even even if we go with a group okay
B: If we don't go on a tour when you go out it's always the whole group going out it's in
C: Ya lah
C: Ya the only thing is that we know each other more help
B: No doubt ya but then we won't
B: Ya"
121,"B: Aiyah I have the rest of my life to spend with him
C: <unclear> word </unclear> to spend with him I agree I agree I agree <unclear> word </unclear>
A: 'A' in for in in a foreign country not in Singapore uh
B: No but we will have a lot of tours after that lah
A: Are you sure
C: You know you know why or not because they'll going to stay there for two weeks you know Can you imagine Ten days okay
B: Ya we're going I think I I will have enouh of him"
122,"B: So
C: Cecilia
B: 'A' don't add this in Don't add <unclear> word </unclear> in okay
C: okay lah okay lah okay lah
A: Censored censored </X> </I>"
123,"A: If you want to come that's fine too usual type
A: And then of course there are the P-T-A school parent-teacher association
A: Uhm I think a number of schools in Singapore have taken this kind of approach now but mainly I think the pity is that most of them <unclear> word </unclear> to fund raising
A: You know they are referring to curtains ah wanna donate money to build the swimming pool and things like that
A: That's about it alright
A: And of course there are the true community schools where uh surely you read the report about the new Raffles Girls' school where they're going to have uh open up the school premises for computer classes <unclear> word </unclear> in the evening alright where they're going to welcome parents in to uhm conduct courses for the students in there okay that's a community school
A: So when you go to school the next time you're going to see for yourself what what what kind of school do you think your school falls under"
124,"A: And sometimes the parents will ask you in school uh when they talk with the teachers in in the process of talking with the teachers they can learn something about how important the parental role is just a guidance and supervision
A: Not only in academic areas but in the others in social emotional development <unclear> word </unclear> right
A: And of course parents can make some significant significant contributions to the school
A: Ah not sure whether you re have read articles about uh schools like St Nicholas
A: Have you read anything about the art where they actually ask parents to come in to talk on certain programs
A: Is anybody familiar with that kind of uh interaction that St Nicholas school has
A: Do you know what what they do"
125,"A: To teach courses I see
A: Now what sort of courses can you
B: Story-telling
A: Ah okay story-telling
A: Oh parents are involved with reading program
A: They actually break the children into small groups and parents come in to read to the kids or they help out in help help out in library work and things like that okay
A: And I think they do something about gardening too right"
126,"A: I think they've this thing called Meet the Parents and they've lots of concerts where they invite parents right
A: Uh I don't know how many of your parents went to school
A: Okay this some of the ways to establish good relationship with the to make the school as a welcoming place
A: Uh well as <unclear> word </unclear> says inviting school lah you know facilitating this inviting environment
A: Are there things around parents can walk in and see that they know that they are welcomed alright
A: They'll talk about I know the oversea they talk about parents' room they even have special bulletin boards for parents you know when they can hold up some information for parents
A: I'm not sure whether this is done in Singapore I don't think any school has a parent room"
127,"A: So I think parents uh can be asked to fork out there
A: Okay so these are some of the ways and some very specific ways would be uh written communication where there are class bulletins there there are newsletters especially for parents got to bring the facts there
A: Now I was in the hospital last time <O> laughs </O>
A: Yah okay so there are there are special newsletters for parents involve parents in <unclear> word </unclear> in school and future events and uh some achievements of students there and things like that lah okay
A: Uh as far I know <unclear> word </unclear> A-C-S has one Report Express
A: Not sure about other schools
A: Have you come across any"
128,"1: First of all waste stabilisation occurs only in the reactor that is here
1: That means you're saying there is no waste stabilisation occurring in the settling tank
1: Now this of course will be conservative since there will be some degree of waste stabilisation by the micro-organisms in the settling unit as well right
1: But for analysis we make this assumption that any B-O-D ah with <unclear> word </unclear> taking place only in this unit Secondly volume use in calculating the mean cell residence time all the system includes only the volume of the reactor unit okay
1: So since this follows up from here right since there's no B-O-D <unclear> word </unclear> in this unit alright you may consider the mean cell residence time you only take into account the volume of your reactor
1: Okay so by definition the mean hydraulic retention time all the reactor that teta will be d over q v will be your volume of your reactor that your fluid b ah b is constant
1: This time if you consider hydraulic retention time for the systemthen for the system b will be reactor volume plus <unclear> word </unclear>tank volume alright"
129,"1: Now this of course will be conservative since there will be some degree of waste stabilisation by the micro-organisms in the settling unit as well right
1: But for analysis we make this assumption that any B-O-D ah with <unclear> word </unclear> taking place only in this unit Secondly volume use in calculating the mean cell residence time all the system includes only the volume of the reactor unit okay
1: So since this follows up from here right since there's no B-O-D <unclear> word </unclear> in this unit alright you may consider the mean cell residence time you only take into account the volume of your reactor
1: Okay so by definition the mean hydraulic retention time all the reactor that teta will be d over q v will be your volume of your reactor that your fluid b ah b is constant
1: This time if you consider hydraulic retention time for the systemthen for the system b will be reactor volume plus <unclear> word </unclear>tank volume alright
1: So your mean cell residence time teta c we call that definition teta c will be mass of cells in the reactor over mass of cells wasted per day
1: Mass of cells in the reactor that's v-x in the reactor"
130,"1: The outgrowth this is the amount leaving the reactor the amount leaving the settling unit and that will be your net growth
1: So now we come back to the assumptions we say we usually make
1: Assuming cell concentration and inflow is zero i-e x-y is zero
1: Steady state the x vility is zero then this means this is zero this is zero and simplifies to you just bring over this side you get this expression here equals to v multiplied by r-g prime r-g prime being your next specific uh your net growth your net ah bacterial growth rate alright
1: And of course your r-g prime is equals to this expression here without the x term
1: So if you divide by d-x and if you look at this term here and what we define as one over teta c in the previous transparency this actually would be one over teta c alright
1: In the previous transparency this term here the left hand side term is one over teta c"
131,"1: This time this would be the mass of cells that is wasted from your settling unit that will be the amount leaving your settling unit alright
1: So distance here will be changed slightly
1: Again assuming x-e is very small then it simplifies the this expression
1: So to calculate x which is your concentration of your ah cells within the reactor
1: It's the same expression as you've seen before same expression except that now teta c takes a different expression alright
1: I have discussed only about x so far
1: What about your substrate concentration or your B-O-D which is s"

A: She's here to tape uhm the lecture for uh research
A: Uhm today is the last lecture for for the history of music course
A: Ah and we'll be covering very briefly uhm compo composers and compositions from the nineteen fifty onwards
A: None of these compositions that I'll be mentioning are on the wide listening list
A: These are additional works which you might have to identify to in the unknown so okay please listen to the features of these composition when you ah are listening now uh
A: Okay by the nineteen fifty now a majority of performers and composers had already familiarised themselves with uhm the twelve tones serial technique of Schoenberg <unclear> word </unclear> and Webern as we were discussing two weeks ago"

A: Okay by the nineteen fifty now a majority of performers and composers had already familiarised themselves with uhm the twelve tones serial technique of Schoenberg <unclear> word </unclear> and Webern as we were discussing two weeks ago
A: Uh not all of them accepted the serialisation techniques of these composers but for those who did such as Babbit B-a-b-b-i-t and Messiaen
A: Those that adopted the twelve tones techniques went further and serialised almost all aspects of music composition"
134,"A: Now these composers favoured more control with con more control over their compositions
A: So they wanted every aspect of their composition serialised and on the other hand there was another group that favoured less control over their composition
A: Now these composers included Cage Cage Boulet B-o-u-l-e-t Stockhausen S-t-o-c-k-h-a-u-s-e-n
A: Of course Stockhausen and Boulet also wrote serial ah serial music okay
A: Now there were two opposing camps and one favoured music as thought thought processing huh control and the other as sound
A: Two camps
A: One is thought and one is sound freedom"
135,"A: Occasionally the instrumentalists were uh requested to say these sounds too to participate vocally rather than just playing
A: The percussion ensemble well increased in size as well and there was a a greater need for more exotic instruments that were being used
A: Instruments such as the gamalan uhm the gongs more Asian instruments that were used this time
A: For the sirens when <unclear> word </unclear> siren a fire instrument to be used in the ensemble could actually it's a pity we took the uhm projector from here lah
A: Uhm I made this transparency to show you the trends that took place in the nineteen after nineteen hundred okay
A: You can see we have experimental tradition right at the top nineteen twenties and we have mainstream okay
A: Mainstream we have people like Ravel in the mid composing alongside and then under experimental tradition we have composers such as Ives Shoenberg Webern <unclear> word </unclear> huh"
136,"A: Uhm improvisation techniques like composers uh gave performers a free hand and doing what they want I'll go on further with this and parallel to this we see chance music which uh John Cage is a very important proponent of this kind of music uhm
A: And further down the line before sixties we see new instrumental technique improvisational groups further on and live electronic music that comes straight down from the experimental tradition and theatre music happenings and anti-art
A: Maybe I'll I'll make a copy of this for you all since you're can't read this okay
A: So you see the tradition of the composers streaming ah taking opting for one route or the other but of course during the fifties uh it's a very experimental time and most composers dabbled at one or the other like Stockhausen's works uh Messiaen Babbit too and some of them would also write for non serial or chance music okay
A: Then we go on to Berio which I'll speak on briefly because uh I brought the CD along the songs for Cathy which Berio wrote for his wife Cathy Berberian B-e-r-b-e-r-i-a-n and I'll play the sequenza for you Sequenza Three for voice for his wife which he wrote in fifty six
A: Okay Luciano Berio B-e-r-i-o was born in nineteen twenty five in <unclear> word </unclear> nineteen twenty five <unclear> word </unclear>
A: He's a composer conductor and teacher and explored much theater music"
137,"A: Now what we will do today for the first half hour or so is I want to uhm go through the answers alright for the assignment questions that are given to you okay
A: You all settle down please
A: Alright the first assignment question was question five c
A: Okay I think most of you manage to do this question but some of you well I don't know what to say here ah but anyway this is the answer right
A: Now in the question five c you were asked whether a precipitate will form when the pH of a point 01 mole per dm cube solution of magnesium chloride is adjusted to ten
A: Now in the previous tutorial I gave you this hint right
A: The hint the key word is supposed to be pH ten"
138,"A: Any of you all have any questions
A: Yes
A: Yes
A: No what you're talking about is ah you're confusing number of moles and concentration
A: Now whether I have two hundred and fifty cm cube or or one thousand cm cube solution alright a saturated solution of silver chromate will always have the same concentration of silver ion but the number of moles present in two hundred and fifty cm cube and present in one thousand cm cube will be different okay
A: Alright uhm now if you see in seven a okay what is the mass of AG plus in one dm cube of a saturate solution of silver chromate
A: Alright now that means your answer will be gram for every one dm cube correct"
139,"A: That's also AG plus concentration alright
A: So it's the number of moles in one dm cube
A: Yes yes
A: Ya oh no no no no if you read seven b ah what is the maximum mass of hydrogen chloride that can dissolve in two hundred and fifty cm cube of a saturated solution of silver chromate saturated solution of silver chromate and uh for seven b and seven a also saturated solution of silver chromate
A: So in both cases seven a and seven b one is one dm cube the other one is two hundred and fifty cm cube However both are saturated solution and therefore no matter what the volume you have for solution your concentration of silver plus is still is still the same because both solutions are the same it's just that you have different volumes of them <X>
A: However your number of moles of silver plus will be different There'll be more in the one thousand cm cube than in two hundred and fifty cm Concentration is different What No there is no dilution You don't transfer or what you just use the same solution and you just bubble in HCL that's all okay Alright Any other questions None </X> </I>"
140,"1.0: So ancient
1: Ah okay okay
1.0: So we'll finish up the last chapter before we go on
1.0: Anyway they are all related to soil so it's quite okay
1.0: Right I think if I'm not mistaken did I did I finish up this with you"
141,"1.0: Ya okay and then of course most soil will not be able to reach the bed-rock level
1.0: So most of the time we are making use of the top soil
1.0: Right tying your hair now is it
1: Now this one its its experiment uhm we did is this ah something like that ya
1.0: Uhm this is to show you which level is occupied by what
1.0: The lower levels would be stones then we have large particles then small particles silt very small particles clay human and living material right
1.0: So the top part okay"
142,"1.0: If you are in the if you are growing in the region or rather if you are a plant you grow in the region where there is only clay it's very bad only sand is very bad
1.0: You will be very lucky if you can find a place where you have good soil and then germinate and grow
1.0: Uhm that is the reason why dispersal of seed is very important
1: If the if if you make use of a very good dispersal mechanism ah then you'll land in a good place and you will sprout there okay
1.0: So uhm most of the time plants will produce lots of seed so that just in case you know uhm only a few of them would find a good place to germinate alright and a lot of time also the seeds are able to uhm remain dormant that is they do not germinate at all if they are uh blown to a place whereby the condition is not right
1.0: So they will just stay there dormant and hope that another gust of wind or animal or whatever will bring them to somewhere else to germinate okay
1.0: So soil condition is very very important to plants alright"
143,"1.0: Remember when we did soil we said that uhm soil is obtained when we through weathering of rock and so on
1.0: So this the most or rather im immediate supply will be when rocks become weathered down by uh the different rain sun and all this type okay so you get sedentary soil alluvial soil will be composed of mineral particles which have been carried long distances from their place of origin through valley bottom and coastal plain and usually this is through by this is by what
1.0: How how are these soil transported
1: Ah
1.0: Again water rain natural elements okay natural elements wind and so on okay
1.0: Alright Topsoil and subsoil okay are with the top type of soil
1.0: You have loam soil yesterday we give we we we did not have a chance to do loam soil but we had what uh what soil as you know in garden soil okay that is uh after it has been treated uh okay"
144,"1.0: Clear or not
1.0: I'm nervous you know <O> laughter </O>
1.0: Okay
1: Ah let me introduce you to this pretty lady here
1.0: Alright she's a good friend of mine
1.0: Her name is Brenda Koh
1.0: She's doing a some kind of a research on the kind of English I use"
145,"1.0: One two three four five
1.0: Who said there's a current
1.0: You all don't know
1: I put up my hand means have lah
1.0: You all never put up your hands alright
1.0: There is a current
1.0: What is the nature of the current"
146,"1.0: What's the resistance of material
1.0: N-type material
1.0: Don't know
1: Don't know ah
1.0: Know or not
1.0: Know or not
1.0: Any material right"
147,"1.0: Alright we call this the saturation current for the JFET
1.0: Can or not
1.0: Okay now next thing
1: I'm going to make it more complicated ah
1.0: Can I let's say I don't consider this voltage
1.0: Put in a voltage here alright
1.0: Put in available voltage here what happen"
148,"1.0: And then at the point where VGG equals to your pinch down voltagea then it will join together and your ID equals to zero all the time alright then you get a case where you call this the pinch down phase ID equals to zero
1.0: Understand
1.0: Yes
1: Understood understood ah
1.0: Yes Mr Eddy
1.0: Do you know what you are asking or not
1.0: Come come come come ask ask"
149,"1.0: Do you know what you are asking or not
1.0: Come come come come ask ask
1.0: Can you all hear or not
1: Louder lah come on
1.0: The mike cannot hear hurry up louder
1.0: Okay how come there's a reverse bias to the p and the n
1.0: Let's say I don't have this uh okay"
150,"1.0: It sounds very long doesn't matter all you need to remember is this formula okay
1.0: This guy equals to this
1.0: That's what it means alright
1: Ah I told you before engineers define things by equations so here we define Gm as a common-source forward transconductance as change in ID over change in VDS for constant value or for a value of VDS equals to zero that means to shock the you shock the drain source voltage alright
1.0: This is current divide by voltage which is a conductance
1.0: Alright conductance is measured in <unclear> word </unclear>
1.0: Alright typical values from one to ten <unclear> word </unclear>"
151,"1.0: Okay the time is thirty
1.0: I can go on
1.0: Have I finished two thousand words
1: Not yet ah
1.0: I no voice already
1.0: Actually I plan to stop here one you know but I haven't reached two thousand words so I must carry on alright
1.0: Okay never mind it's very fast alright"
152,"A: Okay that multi-track recording must be mixed down onto a two-track tape okay
A: Uhm tell Emily that she should be <unclear> word </unclear> in the other room
A: Uh
A: Ah with Mike
A: Okay what I want you to do is take a look at the script and try to identify the elements that they have okay
A: And wait first we have sound effects right
A: Uh which one"
153,"1.0: There is no short cut uhm
1.0: Unless you got certain input you can't really proceed very well
1.0: But after you got all the necessary input and you're able to sense or to recognize the problem from different angles then you come to a more uh subconscious or even unconscious called incubation where you are sleeping over the problem
1: Somebody will say aiyah I think we cannot find the answer today let us sleep over it and think it over you know in our quieter time or something like that and you will find that this is uh where your mind your conscious mind then let your unconscious mind that means a bigger part of your mind think about it and sometimes you may have realized that uh after you had a good sleep you wake up oh you say ah I have found the solution oh now I know the solution huh <X>

1: Alright fine
#: What
1: Ah yes well never mind
1: It's it's a bit of unavoided since that's already there okay
1: Right we're going to go through Much Ado and last week we started talking about <unclear> word </unclear>
1: Yes"
175,"1: Let's start with that because you need to be absolutely sure how this text works
1: Now please be highly conscious that this is identical to Lear in terms of perceptions
1: You are going to always one of the principles that there is no one view about love that's presented by Shakespeare
1: But you're rather going to have ah multiple views presented by the multiple sets of characters
1: Now we've identified this now
1: Who are the sets of characters who are directly in the issue of love
1: Okay Beatrice and Benedict"
176,"A: Mr Goh Chok Tong has asked for the endorsement for his premiership and he says the PAP will get their endorsement if it improves on its 1988 percentage
A: By how many percentage points
A: Do you think it will have to improve to gain a comfortable margin Bilveer
B: Ya while dangerous to speculate I think after Nomination Day results and in view of the lack of general substantive issues ah as I see in this particular election my guess is to get a clear mandate anything between sixty four to sixty eight would be regarded in my view as a clear endorsement
A: Thian Ser do you share the view
C: It's not a bad number to put into a ball park area
C: In part because the Prime Minister has said that he wants more open views"
177,"D: So I think this campaign hangs on his personality and whether the changes have taken place because we have seen accommodation of uh some of the ? opposition type views into the PAP's style of government now
D: At one time it was the the general consensus was that the government is very confident of itself it states its case that's it
D: But now we're getting a position where the PAP is sort of saying well we have a position but we're willing to listen to the public we're listen to to to to the voters
D: That's happen in say the ah car policy that's now happening in the area of health cost
D: So I think Mr Goh says to be judged on his personality and approach it it would be appear to be an important issue here
D: I would agree with clear with things here that the real question is actually political legitimacy
D: I think there is a feeling that he has been given the premiership without the mandate of the people and now he think the timing is right"
178,"C: I think the the worries over the economy probably there's some pros in it I mean what's happened in Russia is very major
A: Is the government concerned about the possible economic downturn
A: I'm not sure they hasn't said that openly but uh many people in the business sector are concerned of possible fears because cost are still rising in the economy and that's a problem
D: And I think in addition to that ah in this country I think what hits the pocket is politically significant and I think there is a perception I mean it may be wrong but at least there's a perception even in the public mind that the economy is taking slowly but surely a flight
D: And politically if you don't hit now and you hit later whether in 92 or 93 I think it can be costly
D: So it's from that perspective that I think the timing factor and its relationship with economic cannot be dismissed
A: If we can come back to Mr Goh pushing himself as the issue in this election uh is there a risk for him in doing this Peter"
179,"C: I think people will go out to vote if not for anything at least for Mr Goh
C: I've heard people saying I like Mr Goh I don't like the MP I don't know what to do but I'd rather vote with Mr Goh than take a gamble you know
A: Peter do you think in announcing a by-election in twelve to eighteen months Mr Goh has in fact undercut the strategy of the opposition <X>
A: I don't think so because uh you know the uh the uh the the bas the basic strength of the SDP's tactic in saying look let's fight this by-election is still there you know whether whether it's by-election now or by-election one and a half years from now so it's a it's a good move on the SDP and uh it's a it's a very uh compelling argument so we come back to the point of performance of the candidates and the party's performance so government must show must I think make uh recognise that uh one big factor is the Fanner's concept that people now have you know and the fact that government has reformed today you know it's going to make that an e even more important factor that you got to appear to be fair I like to take up a point that Bilveer raise which is that uh the issues are very different this tim eI think he's right on that score the issues are different but it does not make the election easier precisely because more people in the constituencies will be able to take the view well if we have a few more opposition members in parliament what is so wrong with that uh that's going to be a factor in this coming elections I think the other point that many people will have to consider would what kind of manifestos are the opposition parties coming up with the concept of gracious society is in a way within the PAP's manifesto I think unless the opposition is not conscious So are you saying then there really aren't any clear differences between the manifestos of the opposition and the PAP Bet you PAP will disagree with that But i would I would tend to say that the PAP have been very successful in hijacking many of the opposition parties' manifestos especially when it come to talking of uh the lower classes talking about the poorer people I think this caring compassionate society has been very successfully uh modelled on by Mr Goh and it's really I think going to deliver That's one I'm coming to the by-election strategy I think people are confused you know you have not run your GE you're already talking about your by-election That's one I think Number two it was mainly to overcome two basic arguments one was the SDP call for treating it as a by-election Number two was the J.B.J. problem and the fact that he chose to address it people amy argue that eh ther's something in it you know you just can't dismiss it as a ploy a tactic and I think people are beginning to think seriously about it and that that maybe this is an afterthought rather than really something thought through and that may in fact hurt Mr Goh in th long run Do you see the issues changing over the next ten days of the campaign you know anything can happen from Nomination Day to Polling Day but uh that's a a gen a general truth I would argue but uh my sense said i would not feel that fundamental of a change I think there will be basically quite low-key unless the opposition is able to come on with something out of their head But Mr Goh has draw has drawn the ground rules in the sense by pitting himself as the centre of this arena so it will be about mr Goh this time but perhaps uh longer run the worry will be a about Mr Goh's political role within the neighbourhood in uh ASEAN and so on the opposition parties need to come out more strongly with uh manifestos in respect of where they want Singapore go in the future Well I think it's not a manifesto bad backward all you know because the positions have have already closed uh closed closed up the the the uh endorsement of of mr Goh and uh I think he has a lot of goodwill and a lot of people will vote for him but that would that could be uh negated to some extent by local issues like constituencies and how the uh the candidates uh look because the uh I think Singaporeans become more sophisticated now they they do not accept the argument that unless I have a the PAP has a bigger mandate in percentage terms is going to be bad for the country so it's not that black and white lah Now while though the local issues are important at this particular time in point somehow or another they have been made quite insignificant by the fact that there is a call and the call is where does Mr Goh stand not just now maybe in the next decade or so I think that's very pressing well the last election was described as a watershed election now if you had to describe this one in just one word what would you say Peter we'll start with you Turning point Legitimacy Mr Goh's election Thank you gentlemen for your views well tomorrow the hustings begin with political rallies and dialogue sessions the campaign will continue for nine days after which you decide who to give your vote to good night </X> </I>"

C: Uh so this this way it allows the employers who are who have never had the experience of employing disabled to take in disabled for a trial period
C: And they're assured that for the first one and a half months the salaries are borne by this fund
C: We also provide tax incentives to employers who make work site modifications in order to accommodate the uh disabled"
260,"C: I think I've I've replied to most of his points under the under the disabled
C: Sir I move on to the aged population
C: Both Mr Tarmugi and Dr Michael Lim have also have spoken on the aged <X>
C: Sir the aged is an issue which should concern all of us that is because our aged population will increase very significantly Today only nine percent of our population are aged above sixty By the by the year twenty thirty about one in four of our population would be above the age of sixty and one there'll be one aged to two persons in the working age group of fifteen to sixteen So I think this is a problem which is of uh which will have great significance uh and great and and uh many implications for society in Singapore Now what is heartening and important to note is that fortunately most elderly are actually healthy Our studies show that about ninety three percent of elderly are fit active and healthy Only five percent are frail and about two percent are bed-ridden Sir because of the large number of elderly that we'll be having in the uh future the responsibility for caring for the aged falls on all of us everyone the family the community the government and the aged themselves Sir in lloking after the aged we must preserve the family as the best social insurance for its members because by the year twenty twenty thirty even if we want to we won't be able to find enough economically active people to lookj after the aged because the numbers the number of the uh aged will be so great Sir the family setting allows the aged to grow old graciously in familiar surroundings and therefore help them to maintain their self-worth and dignity The our programs are therefore directed towards helping them to live within the community Sir Mr Tarmugi has asked in terms of caring for the aged sick and poor what is the amount of health uh what are we doing in terms of providing health facilities and uh in terms of helping us to meet the needs of the elderly what sort of institutional what sort what are we doing in terms of providing inti in uh insitutional care and in terms of helping them to live within the com the community Sir our programs which are aimed at helping the aged to live within the the uh families and the community are aimed at promoting self-help or mutual help because for every frail elderly there'll be at least twenty fit and healthy elderly So whilst we have very few working people to help look after the elderly in the future we must not forget we'll have a large number of very fit and healthy uh older person who should then participate in helping to look after themselves Sir the success of our programs to help the aged depends on uh how the public perceives and perceives the aged in the process of aging and how they accept the aged I think there's a tendency to perceive the aged as being sickly dependent and decrepit We must change such an sttitude if we are going to be able to encourage more members of the public to come forward to participate in uh providing assistance to the uh to the elderly So what the gov the government is doing is that we are having a annual public awareness and public educaiton program on the aged in order to enhance the level of awareness of the population Now the highlight of this program is is our Senior Citizens' Day and uh I'm glad to say that the program has been quite successful because the level of participation in our Senior Citizens' Day's program at both the national and the constituency level are have been increasing Sir in terms of for the aged relief alone my family run uh my Ministry runs a befriender service scheme which helps to recruit volunteers and matches them to the Senior citizens The volunteers befriend advise and assist the aged to cope with their daily demands of living within the community because it is important for us to encourage and to assist the elderly to live within the community and to only be uh obtaining institutional care as a matter of last reort In line with that we also have the uh Home Nursing Foundation assisted by the Ministry of Health which provides a home nursing service and trains members in the care of their aged dependents WE also provide uh screening and medical counselling in such centres Sir the Singapore Action Group of Elders uh also has established a hot-line and counselling service for the aged and uh they are able to provide advice counselling and referral uh services for the elderly who are who are who require such services Mr Speaker: Mr Yeo we are running out of time on this amendment Mr Yeo Cheow Tong: Okay Yes Sir Mr Speaker: You you Mr Yeo Cheow Tong: Sir so in terms of helping them to live within the community we have a lot of programs In terms of institutional care we will also be there're there're already adequate nursing homes and uh other facilities uh we will be helping the VWOs increase the number of uh places in the homes to meet the requirements for the for the coming yeasr by funding eighty percent of the cost of these new facilities In terms of uh recurring expenses we will also be helping them Sir we we will therefore be making sure that we have enough institutional uh facilities uh to to help look after those who require institutional care Sir let me move on to uh the issue of public assistance Sir the public assistance scheme is meant to help the financially distressed to regain their independence It's not meant as an unemployment retirement or disability allowance Sir we grant uh allowances to the aged destitues the disabled and the chronically sick the orphans and the widows Sir the the scheme has to be stringent I know members are not very comfortable with or some members are not comfortable with that but our scheme has to be stringent in order to encourage the able body to re to uh rely on themselves and not to rely on the dole Sir if we don't that don't do that then I think we 're heading down the slippery road to uh disaster On no one in Singapore is denied the opportunity to apply for PA Sir but whilst we open the door for all to apply I think we must be careful to ensure that whilst we have a soft heart we don't have a soft head because as Dr Lim has mentioned some members in his constituencies feel shy about applying They feel that it's a shameful thing to do Sir I think it's not at all a bad emotion because if they are if they feel that it is degrading to apply and therefore they re they are able to rely on their own other mechanisms as well as to rely on other organizations to help them I think it's a it's a very good thing We should Dr Michael Lim: Speaker Sir can I just clarify Well uh my point is that uh they've actually applied and uh they have uh actually been interviewed and have been accepted for the scheme but uh because of the following the interview they felt that it was as if they were begging and therefore they declined their assistance and came to us for assistance but our assistance is limited Mr Yeo: But they've gone ahead to apply and they have been interviewed then why have they withdrawn the application Sir the the key thing is now the key thing is we want to be sure that only those who are genuinely in need and who are unable to find other forms of assistance apply for PA assistance That must be the basis and for those who have applied they we must subject them to some interviewing to ensure these are the genuine cases I think there's no other way Sir for us to sort out the genuine from the non-genuine But i can assure uh members that the interviews are done very professionally they're non-threatening they're in no way meant to embarrass the applicants and also the data and information gathered are treated very confidentially Sir when I'm when I uh went into MCD I made sure that all rejections were seen by me to ensure that the rejections were valid I'm glad to say that in all rejections in in all rejection cases while I was in MCD and before that the uh rejections were valid because the applicants really upon investigation were found that they have either adequate savings of their own or they were actually being supported by their families by their children relatives So all the cases were rejected on good grounds Sir Mr Speaker: Mr Yeo Mr Yeo: Sir but nonetheless Mr Speaker: Would you like to wind up your answer Mr Yeo: Okay Sir what uh what we want to stress is that the PA scheme is adequate we do review the rates we do ensure that the the uh PA allowances are adequate to ensure that the PA recipients are able to survive and more moreover more importantly we also on top of the PA scheme are able to draw on other resources to help the uh recipients Dr Michael LIm: Uh Speaker Sir can I just add one last statement Uh it appears it appears that my twenty nine year old uh housewife with three children will not find solace in your answer uh perhaps uh Minister before he just ends would like to make a comment about the proposal I made with regards to the widowed woman with the children Mr Yeo: Sir I'm not familiar with his twenty nine year old uh widow the case of the twenty nine year old widow if he feels that the the uh widow has got good grounds he shoudl as MP write in to reappeal and I'm sure my my my ah offi officials would uh reconsider In terms of his uh his suggestion that we we channel the PA grants through the CCCs Sir I'm that in the first place that his CCC uh was able to provide some help I think that's a right way to go The the payment of the PA allowance through the POSB is a very convenient one It imposes no inconvenience on the recipients Mr Speaker: Mr Yeo I think you've answered Mr Dr Lim already Mr Tarmugi Is member given leave to withdraw his amendment Amendment withdrawn

A: There's always these two concepts you see
A: Now this is the death benefit uh so on the event of death we pay this amount <X>
A: How much You check off against the year here alright Now this is a policy year we run it from one to twenty This is a summary of your age at five-year intervals right Now it will go on until nineteen ninety but I stop at seventy because there's no place for the computer printout So this is what we pay on death ah in the event of diagnosis of disease fifty thousand is paid one off and uh on disability we pay over five years the full amount you see Now this is the medical part which is included there already Now this is the interesting part nuh the parent-child option which I was explaining to you I I do not know whether you're planning to start a family soon if I'm not right right Uh let's say you you have a kid now I I just run a hypothetical example alright Let's say you have a kid now uh uh a son you just born of course uh it doesn't mean that you must have a son now you can have a son two years from now you see and then you can register him under this rider which is given free to you if you buy the plan So when your son is eighty one if you transfer the plan to your son we will give you back twenty-six thousand alright Your son's coverage will start at hundred and twenty thousand but he is only paying this premium rate per month per year sorry per year Now this you can see is an extremely cheaf cheap rate of seven hundred and four dollars per year and that is twenty-one years from now Assuming hypothetically that you have a new-born son now but if you have a son two years from now the rate is even cheaper you see because your son is not born yet So the rate is seven o four per year alright and uh this money is given back to you This is his insurance this is his premium Now we can extrapolate uh into the into the future So let's say you have passed to your son at twenty-one when your son is sixty years of age uh if you terminate the plan you will get back he will get back two hundred eighty-five thousand and this coverage will be this amount here This is his coverage when he's sixty years of age We are now projecting into the future but all the time he's only paying this premium which is that of a small baby just born you see If I can just show you by a straight line graph uh you see let's call let's look at this This is premium rate and this is uh age huh So uh are you familiar with statistics Uh now as you get older and older Mrs Lee your premium rate will increase but once you have bought the plan the rate is fixed you see So it depends where you come on board you see alright Now the older you are of course the more expensive it is because we are more susceptible to diseases So assuming now your son when he's twenty-one you pass him the plan by right he should be paying this premium rate here alright of a twenty-one year old but actually what he's paying is this premium rate here of a newborn infant backdated to the year he was born you see that that is the whole concept you see but even if he your son is born healthy uh or your daughter is born healthy there is no guarantee that they will remain healthy until twenty-one you see So even along the way if they develop a medical problem at twenty-one they are guaranteed of this uh of this plan you you know what I'm trying to say Now basically this is the the plan that we have been selling quite a lot of it around here to to the to uh I've some of it in the law faculty you see Uh this is the summary alright this is a summary whereby you stop paying after fourteen years This one you have the option of paying till sixty-five you know after fourteen years you need not stop you can keep on paying till sixty-five then you follow this scenario here Then this is your covering letter and this is a brochure which explains a bit of what I have just told you the parent's option alright where you can pass it to your kid and uh I've also enclosed one plan for your husband in case he may be interested to have a talk </X> </I>"

302,"A: What is hundred percent
B: That means there is no uhm no protection only insurance coupled into the program
A: There are some riders
B: Ah
A: I I don't know what whether you call them

303,"A: Ya ya
B: Huh
A: They are riders yes

308,"A: Uh I'm just trying to explore uh what are the various offerings uh in terms of protection only

309,"A: and and then maybe make an assessment whether I can afford or I can't afford

310,"A: Uhm

A: Uh
B: Rough overview lah
B: That's all I can think of right now

314,"B: That's all I can think of right now
A: Ya ya okay

B: Uhm not difficult lah
A: Not difficult because I understand there were some there there're some medical terminology involved
A: It doesn't mean that you have a pain in the heart then you know that's it uh

B: The the one thing the advantage is actually the cost lah
A: Ya
B: What normally what we do when we propose is we normally package it with a savings type policy"
319,"B: from the underwriting point
A: Okay So the advantage of this is that it gives you protection uhm however <unclear> word </unclear>
B: It's on a temporary nature lah

320,"A: Oh okay
B: Uhm but most of them don't
A: Uh huh
B: Uh so you would you're actually paying and paying and paying lah

A: Oh uh huh"
321,"B: there's no loss
A: I see I see okay
B: Uhm
A: so all the interest lah
B: Ya but there's I think there's a offsetting along the way Finally catch up
A: Is that right
B: There is a small cost involved in insurance"
322,"A: Uhm
B: so that the insurance part is actually thirty dollars
A: Right
B: But hundred and twenty would actually go into savings lah
A: <unclear> word </unclear> Uh huh
B: if you look at it from that point of view
A: Uhm uhm okay"
323,"A: <unclear> word </unclear> Uh huh
B: if you look at it from that point of view
A: Uhm uhm okay
B: Okay That's what I meant lah

A: No O: News is always uh the most updated C4: the updated O: Yes
A: Ya O: But then Four-D <&>  4-D </&> and Toto result can
A: I don't want to say that"
328,"B: Okay I I stop payment or the premium and this and I let the policy goes on so this is the uh uh coverage isn't it
A: Okay paid up means that okay at any time uh any one year if you want to stop paying alright if you get that in cash it's going to be very much less than what you're going to get alright
A: So if you opt for pay up means that you know
B: The policy will still run lah
A: It will still down anytime down the years let's say ten years later
A: If you opt for a pay up at tenth time even is uh twenty years down the road it will still pay you that particular value
A: Ya for example if let's say at the tenth year you opt for pay up which is eleven thousand so another ten years down the road okay you will only they will only eleven thousand if something happen to you"
329,"A: It's just no it's up to thirtieth of November but of course uh don't wait until the last minute because uh it may be some complication who knows
B: You think something like Telecoms rush
A: Ya ya ya you'd be surprised you know
B: No lah what Telecoms rush
B: You won't have another Telecoms rush
A: No what I mean of course not
A: But what I'm trying to say is that okay give us two weeks you know because maybe you need a medical check-up you know"
330,"B: You see it's still at the same rate whether I I get the rider or not
A: Ya but presumably let's say if you are medically unfit right now if you have a rider then the company have not right to reject you
A: You get what I'm trying to say
B: Ah ha
A: Alright so the other about this policy is that now if you take it as a rider now this policy or rather the rider will stop paying when you are sixty
A: And the two particular disease which you have Alzheimer and Parkinson and that basically attack a person in their old age
A: And a lot of this problem actually you know uh appears when the person is old and it doesn't make sense you know that you buy this policy to protect you right now but when it come to your old age there's nothing to protect you </I>"
331,"B: Yes I am married
A: Oh good

333,"A: And a small protection of fifteen thousand dollars whole life plan
B: yes yes
A: So what made you to consider to have more insurances now
B: Well uhm ah basically I am earning much more now and uh besides I see a lot of people around me suffering from critical illnesses that really cost a bomb to the family
B: And uh in the end it will leave the family in the lurch when they die
B: So uhm at this moment I wish to save more as well as to provide more protection for my family sake
A: Ok so you feel that you are older now earning a higher income you and you have a family now and also you wish to have the savings as well as protection for your family right"
334,"B: Yah
A: Okay now besides that what other things do you have in mind
A: You must have beard from other companies or from your friends the company's products
B: No ah not much so far
B: As a matter of fact I didn't bother about it initially
B: So I don't really have a grasp of what insurance can offer me
A: Oh I see"
335,"A: Whole life is somewhat different
A: It covers you for life at a much lower premium due to death permanent disability as well as upon diagnosis of critical illness
A: Okay am I going too fast for you Raymond

A: Uh I think it is going to take time lah with all the violence going around there
A: I I think is going even when a stable government is uh elected I think it's still going to take years lah
B: Well very sad man
B: I mean as banker we uh we always hear this kind of comments make us jittery man Anyway thanks for your uh uh allowing us to come by to visit you today"
346,"B: Ya what what do you see of Indonesia

B: I mean as banker we uh we always hear this kind of comments make us jittery man Anyway thanks for your uh uh allowing us to come by to visit you today
B: Actually uh uh we just want to come up to update with you uh as in our all annual exercises lah"
347,"A: I I think is going even when a stable government is uh elected I think it's still going to take years lah
B: Well very sad man
B: I mean as banker we uh we always hear this kind of comments make us jittery man Anyway thanks for your uh uh allowing us to come by to visit you today
B: Actually uh uh we just want to come up to update with you uh as in our all annual exercises lah
B: To to update with you how is business and then we will also want to discuss a little regarding your credit facilities
B: I think you have known uh if you have read the papers uh over the past few months uh in fact the local banks uh we are actually quite heavy laden with the with non-performing loans
B: So Sad to say but uh because of all these we are actually uh forced in certain ways to re-look into all the credit facilities granted to our customers so I think that is basically my objection my my objective today"
348,"B: I know it is a bit difficult but uh
A: Wa still have to reduce some more
B: Ya have to reduce
B: Ah so I know it is a bit difficult given the uh I mean just now like what you say about times are bad and all that but we really really have to come up you know today to tell you basically these are some of the intention that the bank is adopting
A: But but my business is already so bad and I really have some strict cash flow problem and all my facilities in this factory is being stretched to the maximum already and how can you come to me and tell me that you need to reduce my O D line some more
A: I just don't know lah
A: I really don't know"
349,"B: Ya have to reduce
B: Ah so I know it is a bit difficult given the uh I mean just now like what you say about times are bad and all that but we really really have to come up you know today to tell you basically these are some of the intention that the bank is adopting
A: But but my business is already so bad and I really have some strict cash flow problem and all my facilities in this factory is being stretched to the maximum already and how can you come to me and tell me that you need to reduce my O D line some more
A: I just don't know lah
A: I really don't know
B: Uh but actually what we can do is that we we uh we understand your problem but we really hope that Mr Tan you could understand the position we are in lah
B: Although a lot of time people say that you know banks are you know during rainy days uh we will take away the umbrella"
350,"A: But but my business is already so bad and I really have some strict cash flow problem and all my facilities in this factory is being stretched to the maximum already and how can you come to me and tell me that you need to reduce my O D line some more
A: I just don't know lah
A: I really don't know
B: Uh but actually what we can do is that we we uh we understand your problem but we really hope that Mr Tan you could understand the position we are in lah
B: Although a lot of time people say that you know banks are you know during rainy days uh we will take away the umbrella
B: But I hope you all can understand that uh we are also quite badly hit ah
B: Property value have all drop and all that"
351,"A: I really don't know
B: Uh but actually what we can do is that we we uh we understand your problem but we really hope that Mr Tan you could understand the position we are in lah
B: Although a lot of time people say that you know banks are you know during rainy days uh we will take away the umbrella
B: But I hope you all can understand that uh we are also quite badly hit ah
B: Property value have all drop and all that
B: In fact all the all the case in fact ninety percent of our cases uh in our portfolio actually to use the term very crudely we are actually all underwater
B: We are all struggling so we we understand we also understand your O D has been used up to the hilt and then at certain times also you actually went over the limit but uh we are trying to see whether we can do a restructure"
352,"B: Property value have all drop and all that
B: In fact all the all the case in fact ninety percent of our cases uh in our portfolio actually to use the term very crudely we are actually all underwater
B: We are all struggling so we we understand we also understand your O D has been used up to the hilt and then at certain times also you actually went over the limit but uh we are trying to see whether we can do a restructure
B: We are not trying to say we want to bring it back down to two hundred lah you know within twenty-four hours
B: We are looking at a maybe a restructured payment say maybe five thousand per month something like that
B: Something that you are comfortable with hor and then at least uh you know we could use this as a tool and then to tie tide over this period of time
B: For all you know five thousand you know a month over over one year we are looking at only sixty thousand"
353,"B: So if that is the case then I would suggest is that uh but coming back to the point again it is five I mean it is like what I said
B: We are not looking at two hundred thousand although this is uh you know the initial idea that head office has imposed on your account but I am looking at a maybe on gradual basis what about five thousand per month
B: Do you think you can manage with that for the time being
B: So every month we reduce by five thousand lah so over a period of one year we are looking at sixty thousand because if that is OK then maybe again I cannot promise you this is this is only uh a decision on my end here
B: It may be approved it may not be approved
B: But I want to have I want to work out something that is more comfortable so long as you are comfortable I think that is more important
B: At the end of the day you don't over commit yourself to the bank and then if you are something that you are comfortable you can fulfil I think that is more important"
354,"B: Within a week's time and then we see how we go from there
B: If really you have any problem then what we do is that after six months okay we will come back to you again and well we can sit down and then discuss further then
B: I mean let us hope that the economy will recover by then because right now the biggest problem that we have is that we actually uh sitting on a lot of properties like for example these factories that you have now uh last year when I came in it was something like three point five million and then today we are looking at two million so straightaway we are looking at a negative network of about one point five million so this is the biggest headache that we are facing
B: So I think not a problem lah
B: Don't worry
B: I mean I will come to you in say one week's time and then we see how we go from there
A: What about your bank"
355,"B: Oh banks we are affected we are affected
B: Uh in fact if you if you read the uh annual reports of all the local banks we are making hefty provision for the industries so we are badly hit
B: We are badly hit
B: So you know we are not spared lah
B: Okay we are not spared lah
A: Uhm nice to know that I am not alone in all this
B: You are not spared okay"
356,"B: Uh in fact if you if you read the uh annual reports of all the local banks we are making hefty provision for the industries so we are badly hit
B: We are badly hit
B: So you know we are not spared lah
B: Okay we are not spared lah
A: Uhm nice to know that I am not alone in all this
B: You are not spared okay
B: We are all business uh private organisations we are not spared but we have to be prudent huh like living in Singapore we have to be prudent"
357,"A: Uhm nice to know that I am not alone in all this
B: You are not spared okay
B: We are all business uh private organisations we are not spared but we have to be prudent huh like living in Singapore we have to be prudent
B: We have to again uh we have to protect the interest of our share-holders, depositors and all that lah but uh well never mind we see how it will it goes
B: More important I think we want to see that we can help our local enterprise here to ride through this bad times which is the reason why I have said we are always open for discussion although the intention is to reduce your OD limit by two hundred thousand but I think we can always look into a restructured payment
B: Five thousand if it is too difficult for you we try it for six months
B: After six months if you really have problems come back to us OK our doors are open anytime"
358,"C: Will it involve P6 pupils
A: Uh we have checked that
A: We will be remaining open but most of us felt that it should be P5 because P5 pupils June quite close to streaming exam
C: Ah that's right
B: P5 exam
A: So I think the target should be P5 P4 and P6 are out simply because it's too close to the exam
A: So it would be P5 pupils all right"

A: The lights won't have any effects lah
B: Ya
A: Especially it's a school-hall

A: And the he said you had so no one can grudge you on the fact you're not studying lah <unclear> word </unclear>
B: Oh oh
A: Neglect your education and all that
A: And the that if you were to decide to leave"
906,"A: Neglect your education and all that
A: And the that if you were to decide to leave
B: And you've a degree
A: What you're doing now you can always fall back on your degree and on teaching with with say <unclear> word </unclear> lah
B: She said that ah
A: Ya
A: But then I was thinking that MOE may not find that very very flattering that you consider it like you know if everything else fails then you fall back on teaching"
907,"A: And the that if you were to decide to leave
B: And you've a degree
A: What you're doing now you can always fall back on your degree and on teaching with with say <unclear> word </unclear> lah
B: She said that ah
A: Ya

B: <unclear> word </unclear>"
908,"A: But then I was thinking that MOE may not find that very very flattering that you consider it like you know if everything else fails then you fall back on teaching
B: <unclear> word </unclear>
A: When I saw that I saw that that line I said
A: Is this <unclear> word </unclear> okay good lah not not too bad
A: That that one line uh
A: If I was MOE and interview
A: Oh I see"
909,"A: That that one line uh
A: If I was MOE and interview
A: Oh I see
B: Go and tell to MOE lah
B: You got no choice okay
A: You want you take
B: Ya"
910,"A: Ya they become teachers first
A: But then MOE also have a scheme where they bring in professionals that come in you know directly and then teach dance like in in uh NTU they
B: And damn tiring to teach dance you know
B: I find I don't know lah
B: I find need
A: It could be very tiring
B: I find it very"
911,"A: <unclear> word </unclear> No that's why what I meant was that uhm if you you want dance to in a sense uh complement what
B: What I do
A: What you do right rather than it being the main thing <unclear> word </unclear>
A: But then you find that uh I don't know lah
A: I I've seen a lot of people who've gone into teaching and then find that they can spare time later to do dance or whatever
A: You find that it drains you so much that you will not benefit <unclear> word </unclear>
B: Ya it's true"
912,"B: But I mean idealistically speaking I just want to get money and and studying dance somewhere
B: That's idealistically and and like not even wanting to come back and work and hold some kind of responsible position I I
A: Great
B: Good lah
B: But wish but that's not my primary concern right now I mean like
A: You never you would never consider going say joining say SDT or it's very <unclear> word </unclear> lifestyle
B: If I come out <X>"
913,"A: With experiments
B: Ya and create something
B: So I don't know whether whether I'll call myself a choreographer first or a dancer first
B: But the thing I wanna call myself I don't know I <unclear> word </unclear> I don't know what you call it lah
B: But I I like I find my greatest joy uhm sharing whatever things I have with others <unclear> word </unclear> which is actually teaching </X> </I>"
914,"A: Peck Chuan uh
B: Ya
A: So what's your comment about tomorrow's meeting
B: Tomorrow ah
B: Ah tomorrow we're having our staff meeting and I hope Dr Teo can uh let us know our future direction clearer
B: Because uhm I think we're thinking of moving into a lot of new areas but uhm we must have a clear direction and clear commitment from the management
B: Otherwise is a bit difficult for people like us at the bottom"
915,"B: Ya
A: So what's your comment about tomorrow's meeting
B: Tomorrow ah
B: Ah tomorrow we're having our staff meeting and I hope Dr Teo can uh let us know our future direction clearer
B: Because uhm I think we're thinking of moving into a lot of new areas but uhm we must have a clear direction and clear commitment from the management
B: Otherwise is a bit difficult for people like us at the bottom
A: So uhm is is the restructuring of the organisation affecting you anyway"
916,"A: We'll be the frontline
B: Ya
A: For all all the <unclear> word </unclear>
B: I I I'm not so sure exactly how they're going to uh divide the work lah but from what I know it's uhm uhm people like Diane myself Shuefen
B: They all will be doing development work and then when users have problem they won't call us directly they will call I don't know who from your side would be but I think you're one of them uhm when the printer got problem they call you
A: You mean you mean normal problem
A: What I'm referring to is those uhm as I said uh the accounting system you know"
917,"B: They all will be doing development work and then when users have problem they won't call us directly they will call I don't know who from your side would be but I think you're one of them uhm when the printer got problem they call you
A: You mean you mean normal problem
A: What I'm referring to is those uhm as I said uh the accounting system you know
B: Ya so if if there is any of uh any problems that belongs to say say a particular application ah they will still go to the frontline people and if those people cannot solve it then they will channel back to the back up people
A: Oh I see
B: So because uh if say right now uh if the user say our user the account user they they printer got problem they will still call us you know
A: Uhm uhm uhm"
918,"B: Uh the interface uh
A: Solve the the minor minor problems we'll solve
A: But when it comes to a more the more specialised programmes we'll look you'll look into that
B: Ya I think for you guys uh I think you'll still be involved in some development work lah
B: But I think most of the time you're attending to user
A: I hope not because it's supposed to be twenty twenty per cent the most
B: Ha"
919,"B: Ha
A: Am I right
A: And uh I think we'll be also involved development work
B: Ah
A: For me is uh postgrad schools ya and that's already a lot of maintenance actually
B: You expect to get other project
A: Ya ya"
920,"A: What S Q L D S
B: I thought I thought I thought you have to do some S Q L work
A: Uhm you mean oh assessing to the database is it
B: Ah
A: Of course that is that's where all the records are stored
B: All these while you're working on this system lah
A: Yes yes but of course the system sort of like retrieve and manipulates the data in the database"
921,"A: Uhm you mean oh assessing to the database is it
B: Ah
A: Of course that is that's where all the records are stored
B: All these while you're working on this system lah
A: Yes yes but of course the system sort of like retrieve and manipulates the data in the database
A: By the way uh Weiying is supposed to back me up
B: Who"
922,"B: Who
A: Weiying from your group
B: Weiyan uh
A: Ah Weiyan ya suppose to
A: She's suppose to uhm back me up
B: In this system uh
A: Ya which is a surprise to me"
923,"A: It's just like physically uh changing office now
A: Job wise also change
B: Because actually uh you know I'm also working on this exam mark entry system right
B: Actually this one is done by done by a staff quite sometime ago lah and then a William took over and now I was ask to look into it further and
A: Further you mean enhancement
B: Ya maybe got to rewrite the whole thing lah
A: Why"
924,"B: Because actually uh you know I'm also working on this exam mark entry system right
B: Actually this one is done by done by a staff quite sometime ago lah and then a William took over and now I was ask to look into it further and
A: Further you mean enhancement
B: Ya maybe got to rewrite the whole thing lah
A: Why
B: Because ah because we're facing a lot of problems
B: We our there are a lot of departments using it and then they're all over the campus"
925,"A: Further you mean enhancement
B: Ya maybe got to rewrite the whole thing lah
A: Why
B: Because ah because we're facing a lot of problems
B: We our there are a lot of departments using it and then they're all over the campus
B: And then one once they call up complain that there's a problem
B: We can't solve it on the spot we have to go down so it takes a lot of our time"
926,"B: And then one once they call up complain that there's a problem
B: We can't solve it on the spot we have to go down so it takes a lot of our time
B: So we're trying to find out ways to cut down on all this travelling
A: Uhm uhm that means more or less cut down on maintenance lah
B: Ya ya especially ya this thing is only used during exam time lah so
A: Once
B: During this period"
927,"B: We can't solve it on the spot we have to go down so it takes a lot of our time
B: So we're trying to find out ways to cut down on all this travelling
A: Uhm uhm that means more or less cut down on maintenance lah
B: Ya ya especially ya this thing is only used during exam time lah so
A: Once
B: During this period
A: Once a year that sort of thing"
928,"A: Once a year that sort of thing
B: Ya and uh and also for me during this period uh is the the account section
B: They're having their year-end closing so it's a lot of work at us at the same time
B: So this one got to look into it lah
B: I'm currently looking into ways to improve and uh cut down on the the travelling
A: Improving uh by adding on or changing the system or to cut completely new you know
A: language or whatever"
929,"A: Improving uh by adding on or changing the system or to cut completely new you know
A: language or whatever
B: Or I don't know my boss was saying look into client server solution pos
B: That's one possibility ah but I don't think uhm this justifies because this
A: It's too expensive
B: Is going to take up too much time
B: I rather you know during uh this period you can do a bit of walking around rather than <unclear> word </unclear>"
930,"B: Ya <unclear> word </unclear> users than to spend a months to redevelop to whole thing
A: But then if you redevelop it'll be let me think in the long run it'll be beneficial to everyone
B: Yes ya but the thing is when you rewrite probably five years later you've got to revamp the whole thing again
B: So the thing is whether spending this six months is is worth or not for this next five months ah sorry five years and during these five years is not you're not using it everyday
B: You're only using it during the exam period
A: But then you must see that uhm how about personally for saying to think that is beneficial to you
A: I mean you'll be learning a lot of new things"
931,"A: I mean you'll be learning a lot of new things
B: Ya
A: I think you find it quite interesting uhm
B: Ya uh I was telling my boss lah to use it as a as a learning platform
B: That's very good because if you were to move into client server next time we need to start off with some simple project uhm
B: We need to start off with some prototypes so that we can iron out
B: We can avoid uhm committing some serious uhm mistakes in uh in the real system you see so this is a a a good application to start off with lah"
932,"B: Ya uh I was telling my boss lah to use it as a as a learning platform
B: That's very good because if you were to move into client server next time we need to start off with some simple project uhm
B: We need to start off with some prototypes so that we can iron out
B: We can avoid uhm committing some serious uhm mistakes in uh in the real system you see so this is a a a good application to start off with lah
B: So uhm but if you were to develop purely for saving time one then I think this is not the right approach ah probably adding or modifying the existing programme is better
B: Ah so so let's talk about more your work
A: My my work uh"
933,"B: That's very good because if you were to move into client server next time we need to start off with some simple project uhm
B: We need to start off with some prototypes so that we can iron out
B: We can avoid uhm committing some serious uhm mistakes in uh in the real system you see so this is a a a good application to start off with lah
B: So uhm but if you were to develop purely for saving time one then I think this is not the right approach ah probably adding or modifying the existing programme is better
B: Ah so so let's talk about more your work
A: My my work uh
A: Uh at the moment I'm I'm doing of maintenance work and looking into development of uh uh some of the subsystem in addition to this assistance system maintenance"
934,"B: We need to start off with some prototypes so that we can iron out
B: We can avoid uhm committing some serious uhm mistakes in uh in the real system you see so this is a a a good application to start off with lah
B: So uhm but if you were to develop purely for saving time one then I think this is not the right approach ah probably adding or modifying the existing programme is better
B: Ah so so let's talk about more your work
A: My my work uh
A: Uh at the moment I'm I'm doing of maintenance work and looking into development of uh uh some of the subsystem in addition to this assistance system maintenance
A: And uhm it still requires a lot of enhancement"
935,"A: They change things uh now and then you see with new subjects you see with new subjects and so on coming in
A: So that requires a lot of changes to the system and that keeps me very busy ya
B: And on top of that you still got to support what Word Perfect
A: Uhm those are normal uh user supports lah located a a couple faculties to take I mean to take care of all the secretaries and so on for the O A System and general PC problem
B: Actually uh actually is quite interesting and quite good to have exposure to to do some uhm PC work
B: Uh if it is just purely mainframe then it's quite boring at times
A: Uh quite true because mainframe seems that there are much more restrictions than PCs"
936,"B: Maybe there's no more upgrade anymore or what
B: I'm not so sure
A: You mean it's a dead
B: Ya ya but it's working lah
B: Future enhancement
B: Probably there isn't any
A: Oh I see so you're looking into vendor <unclear> word </unclear> that is growing"
937,"B: Uhm no
A: Just
B: Actually even in Personnel also the requirement can be very very high because you're talking about storing uhm uhm all documents you know belonging to each staff belonging to student
B: So when you apply for a job and then your resume your application form everything this probably got to be stored electronically lah
B: So by scanning in as an image and uh uh storing on uhm secondary storage devise
A: Like what like what CD-Rom
B: Optical disc"
938,"B: Optical disc
A: Optical disc
B: Ya it's something called Optical Judebox and that stores many optical disks but then these are very very expensive
B: So currently we are just looking into it lah
A: So what's the chances how's the chance like
B: Uh with that like of budget we have I think it's quite difficult to get uh a a very sophisticated system lah
B: We're just looking into the <unclear> word </unclear> feasibility lah and not not the actual product yet"
939,"B: Ya it's something called Optical Judebox and that stores many optical disks but then these are very very expensive
B: So currently we are just looking into it lah
A: So what's the chances how's the chance like
B: Uh with that like of budget we have I think it's quite difficult to get uh a a very sophisticated system lah
B: We're just looking into the <unclear> word </unclear> feasibility lah and not not the actual product yet
B: And also the user side has not identified exactly what should be <unclear> word </unclear> archive into into uh uh computerised system
B: So that's why I these days I have to call up a lot of vendor <X>"
940,"B: So currently we are just looking into it lah
A: So what's the chances how's the chance like
B: Uh with that like of budget we have I think it's quite difficult to get uh a a very sophisticated system lah
B: We're just looking into the <unclear> word </unclear> feasibility lah and not not the actual product yet
B: And also the user side has not identified exactly what should be <unclear> word </unclear> archive into into uh uh computerised system
B: So that's why I these days I have to call up a lot of vendor <X>
B: I got a lot of meeting go for a lot of seminars"
941,"B: So that's why I these days I have to call up a lot of vendor <X>
B: I got a lot of meeting go for a lot of seminars
A: Is for this purpose
B: Which is quite interesting lah
A: Oh oh oh I thought all the while is current server
B: Current server also
B: That one is looking into uh Oracle Database Diane and myself lah"
942,"B: Which is quite interesting lah
A: Oh oh oh I thought all the while is current server
B: Current server also
B: That one is looking into uh Oracle Database Diane and myself lah
A: I thought it's Informix
B: Previously we're looking at Informix and Oracle plus some hardware
B: But uhm you know there's this task force current server task force so they delegate the work lah"
943,"B: That one is looking into uh Oracle Database Diane and myself lah
A: I thought it's Informix
B: Previously we're looking at Informix and Oracle plus some hardware
B: But uhm you know there's this task force current server task force so they delegate the work lah
B: So actually we're not in the task force but I don't why I got this got to do this also
B: Diane and myself we got task to look into Oracle
B: Interesting"
944,"B: What
A: Any other alternatives since you said it was expensive
B: Actually uhm if you talk about if optical disk has very very high storage capacity
B: If you talk about cost per bit ah per bit of storage ah optical Disk is definitely cheaper than other means like magnetic tapes uh or not uh sorry magnetic disc our our normal uhm hard disk uhm but
A: The initial cost is high
B: Yes
A: Uhm again in the long run is is"
945,"B: Yes
A: Uhm again in the long run is is
B: Cheaper actually ya because you can store a lot more
A: So it really depends on how much data you have lah
A: Whether you real it's really necessary to get
B: Correct
A: Optical disk"
946,"A: So this is the next stage
B: Ya the voice test is very fun
B: The voice test very fun
A: That means after this no more lah
A: Two rounds
B: I think if you get short listed again you go for the interview
A: Uh that's right that's right"
947,"B: I think if you get short listed again you go for the interview
A: Uh that's right that's right
B: Ya because for the NUS one I went for the written test as well
A: So terrible lah
B: They say you are short listed for English test so you go you write a essay and a and a and a formal letter to invite Mr X to come here for a Stress Management Workshop something like that
A: Uh
B: Because it's uh administrative assistant for extra"
948,"B: Department of Extra-mural Studies
B: Just like you know like outside courses
A: Ya ya
B: Those are extra-mural lor
B: So I I didn't know what's extra-mural
B: I just know that I'm qualified for it then I applied
A: It's not easy uh"
949,"A: Ya at least you've a chance you see uhm
B: Ya
A: I've got a friend uh I don't know how many companies she wrote into you know and then not one interview
B: Ya lor
A: Yet
B: The thing is that I don't have enough interviews
B: But what what is her qualification"
950,"B: The thing is that I don't have enough interviews
B: But what what is her qualification
A: Uh just a Bachelor degree ya
B: Ya lor
B: Honours is nothing unless you you you can get a job
B: Then you earn a bit more something like that
B: I'm not sure"
951,"B: Only government is like that
A: Ya
B: Actually I don't I don't think there is a difference
A: Ah
B: Honestly
B: Just spend one more year
A: Uh so"
952,"A: I I thought just go for interview
A: I mean from there they can judge what
B: But at least voice test they must hear you
A: Over the ya lah
B: <unclear> word </unclear> I'm sort of expected a voice test but written test like <unclear> word </unclear>
B: For my friend she just she was just applying for programmer you know like you slot in programmes and then you've to go a test also
B: They have English one and Chinese one"
953,"B: Then I try which one I get in
A: Because like this kind of of stuff uh radio is mainly research
A: Students gone through a degree uh and Honours you've got sufficient skills
B: No lah I've no general knowledge
A: Ya it's the general knowledge that that
B: See
A: They may interview you on that but not a written test"
954,"A: Ya
B: Then these few days
A: Oh you don't read the Chinese as well
B: These few days I read Chinese lah
B: I can't stand it because a lot of things we learn in English
A: Ya you do you don't you take for granted
B: Ya"
955,"B: So it's quite bad
A: Why don't you try for the English department
B: I didn't
A: Try lah you write into
A: I think it's it'll be much easier you know Chinese is like
B: But I thought Chinese it's easier is easier for me
A: Ah"
956,"A: Try lah you write into
A: I think it's it'll be much easier you know Chinese is like
B: But I thought Chinese it's easier is easier for me
A: Ah
B: It is easier
A: Is it
B: For me to talk in Chinese you know"
957,"B: For me to talk in Chinese you know
A: Uh really
B: Well in a way
B: But not not ya lah my my general knowledge is just terrible lah
A: Oh because at home you speak Mandarin right
B: Uhm ya

B: Ya"
959,"A: Aye my is just as bad you know
B: Ya I have no general knowledge you know
A: Is like ya so terrible
B: Even when I try to read papers ah I don't I don't remember what I read
A: Ya you just read and read and
B: Ya I really force myself to read
B: And then okay imagine you have to write out what you want to interview them"
960,"B: Thank God I resitted for the test and then ask me this kind of thing
B: I suppose they expect you to reach a certain standard
A: Ya even in uh uhm right when I did my radio programme
B: Ah
A: Uhm for the beginners uh of course you do things like read you know a story or things like that

A: Like my friend you know you've got to do an academic subject"
961,"B: And then you're not graded for it
A: Ya
B: So it's all self-discipline
B: I know lah

A: But why what's the rationale for for you know having them coordinate for you all
B: Them you see them they were supposed to look into areas like uhm maybe more of market development market opportunities and all
B: I mean they are supposed to be uh specialised in their area and they go and look into ways that help us to increase our plan or programmes you know increase increase our sales and all that lah
A: Ya
B: Then they're supposed in a way to coordinate for us instead of us going to the US and say you know instead they're the only one that contact the US office or whatever
A: But why why did you say it's not working"
1533,"A: It's true
B: So you know they get the best they want a higher price
B: Other countries are willing to pay
B: Some of our Asia Pacific countries uh South Asia ah are not willing
B: We can't afford to pay that high
A: So end up you can't sell right
B: Ya you can't get the goods you may"
1534,"A: If that's the case how to set a budget if if the US quotes that way
B: No man in his
B: Then US sake the rest of you will say you can make this price then we supply
B: There's a minimum price lah you have to have a minimum price lah
B: I mean no doubt we know it's quality product but it depends on individual country status you know whether can they afford to pay that amount of money
B: So sometimes quite difficult for us you know
A: What if they work that way"
1535,"A: What if they work that way
A: What's the point of setting a budget
B: <unclear> word </unclear> Uh
B: No I mean you that's the base lah that means that's your ASB then you know with this amount of price how much you can sell
B: Then you work on it lah

1536,"A: What's the point of setting a budget
B: <unclear> word </unclear> Uh

B: Then you work on it lah
B: Then you get a budget lah
A: But if later
B: What
A: You bid for it you won't get it"
1538,"B: Then if they can locate you the full amount they give you the full amount
B: That means will be allocated quantities to you at this price then that's it
B: No even if let's say in <unclear> word </unclear> in later stage uh other countries are willing to pay higher they cannot give my allocated quantity to them in that sense you see
B: But once I've agreed to this price during the budgeting time I'll if my I'm allocated this quantity this quantity will be for me lah
B: But of course if I can't sell this quantity then there's another issue lah
B: That means I didn't raise my budget you see
A: Uhm"
1539,"B: That means will be allocated quantities to you at this price then that's it
B: No even if let's say in <unclear> word </unclear> in later stage uh other countries are willing to pay higher they cannot give my allocated quantity to them in that sense you see

1541,"A: Uhm
B: Get what I mean
B: If I get can sell it I'll get it lah you know

B: They come up with us
B: It's only in highland we do"
1542,"B: This is only highland because it's an exceptional case in the sense that sometimes you don't have uhm but actually supply is I mean demand is greater than supply
B: But certain other products too have a minimum like price but most of the other places they don't
B: They have a recommended price in that sense that to sell it to your distributors or whatever you see
B: Then it's up to you lah whether you how much issue you wanna make you see

A: I haven't actually think about it but from what yesterday the impression is that uh there's not much of questions being posed to the presenters lah and I personally hope that the presenters and the teacher might not take it might not take questions uhm too personally
A: I mean not as an attack uh personal attack or something like that
A: It's just a purely academic enquiry something like that
A: So it will be more interesting in that sense lah because actually there's a lot of uh things that I wanted to ask lah but judging from the face of the presenter I dare not lah because they might think otherwise you see"
1705,"A: I haven't actually think about it but from what yesterday the impression is that uh there's not much of questions being posed to the presenters lah and I personally hope that the presenters and the teacher might not take it might not take questions uhm too personally

A: You didn't take Physical Geog"
1706,"A: It's just a
B: Ya ya
A: Part of the grading

A: Then there's a lively discussion nah not a very quiet session just a presenter doing his job or something
B: But I guess it I guess the topic dealt with is Physical so no people really bother or they don't know they're not in the line to to ask questions so I guess when it comes to the later portion
A: Ya maybe the Human"
1707,"A: So what are you gonna to do with it

B: Usually like for example under one category only have one or two replied form instead of four or five ya so when it's one or two it would represent the whole you see so that is what I'm worried but as long as I'm able to get something is better than nothing
A: If when you do surveys is normally the case lah unless you do informal surveys over the telephone or doing a tape recording like this then you won't have the problem of surveys not coming back nah
B: The only problem is that you must get to allow you tape the voices to allow you for such interview

A: Ah ha but you have to pay uh
B: Ya you got"
1717,"A: I'm quite interested about the P S C lah especially on the education service but uh my main thrust is to ask them what is because uhm lately there has been calls for increasing teachers' pay so but the details has has not been made known to public so maybe I I hope they can ya that's right
A: But I don't think they will tell me everything lah in details but what I suppose is that they will not exactly touch on the starting pay but more on the increment yearly increment nah because the Civil Service yearly in increment is very little can say is very little
B: Well for my case I won't be interested of any of these simply because I'm already bonded so uhm there's no room for me to look other career until or unless somebody can bail me out of this trap
A: Ah ha but you have to pay uh
B: Ya you got
A: If you want to break the bond you have to pay
B: Yes I have to pay the whole lump sum"
1718,"A: It's a six year scholarship
B: Yes it's a six six years bond
B: Well if you were to continue teaching I mean if you intend to teach right so we might in the same line because my scholarship is actually teaching
A: Teaching scholarship lah
B: Yes
A: Do you know the starting starting pay
B: Well I'm not very sure"
1719,"B: Well I'm not very sure
B: I guess it's about two thousand
A: Two thousand odd
B: For guys because of the N S thing lah yes
A: But during the the course at N I E will be about one thousand three right and I mean ya one thousand three hundred
B: Well about it
A: And I've been looking through the past years in terms of this uh grant you know I mean teaching grant or teaching bursary whatever they call it"
1720,"A: Do you think it's enough
B: Well actually uhm maybe not now maybe later when the time comes I guess the problem will be there
B: I really don't because presently you don't need the money so and you I guess you won't feel the difference but unless during that time when you start to be involved in the whole programme and you need the money then you starts to voice out again
B: So normally you just tackle the problem when the problems come lah
A: Do you think uh the education service has done uh done their part in terms of retaining the the talented the best in terms of uh teachers
B: Well if you were to look at my case most of my lect tutors in J Cs they have left
B: Ya in fact they are all quite good simply because other places or rather the private sides are paying them more than what the teaching line are doing so I guess one of the method is the pay"
1721,"A: Camp
B: Ya some some are involve in like you know English camps in video camps
B: What have you
A: So to make the career more ex exciting in a sense lah
B: Ya
A: But what what do you think of
A: Okay so far the the"
1722,"A: Actually the the only thing that we have uh I mean the don't know lah I mean my school we we we we always thought that the that the headquarters didn't like us
B: Why
A: There is some kind of conception or misconception or some sort lah
B: Really"
1723,"A: Actually the the only thing that we have uh I mean the don't know lah I mean my school we we we we always thought that the that the headquarters didn't like us
B: Why
A: There is some kind of conception or misconception or some sort lah
B: Really
A: I mean because we we we won a lot of competitions
B: True"
1724,"B: It's just talking to us I mean
A: Making conversation
A: Okay all right
A: Ya so so ya I mean I they they they they thought that that we won a little too many lah so ya but there was well I always thought Red Cross should stand for uh the first aid sign lah
A: So actually when when I don't know I uhm when when my my school did better in foot drill I I did question the the rationale
A: Look you know what I mean
A: This you are you're you're supposed surely ought to be better in first aid"
1725,"A: So I guess you didn't really like much drills and all that
A: No actually uh for foot drill I did quite well
A: Ya I think I did quite well at foot drill
A: I enjoyed uhm ya the formations and all that lah
A: I mean it was like quite fun lah you know but there is a lot of hard work lah and I think that because of because of so much drill actually uhm you know physiologically my legs like grew a lot more than my arms
B: Longer
A: Not not longer but I think the the leg muscles are a lot better develop or my leg muscles are a lot better develop than than muscles elsewhere on my body you see"
1726,"A: No actually uh for foot drill I did quite well
A: Ya I think I did quite well at foot drill
A: I enjoyed uhm ya the formations and all that lah
A: I mean it was like quite fun lah you know but there is a lot of hard work lah and I think that because of because of so much drill actually uhm you know physiologically my legs like grew a lot more than my arms
B: Longer
A: Not not longer but I think the the leg muscles are a lot better develop or my leg muscles are a lot better develop than than muscles elsewhere on my body you see
A: Ya so my father said that if you don't do push ups you look like a kangaroo"
1727,"A: Ya so my father said that if you don't do push ups you look like a kangaroo
A: Ya anyway I I actually join the Red Cross because uh I I was hoping to to practice uh to go into medical practice
B: Oh I see
A: Ya so it was like you know look you know there there is some kind of connections so why don't I just use it like a trump card lah so to speak
A: But actually I mean all my involvement with Red Cross uh wasn't I mean I I I don't think the the universities took it very seriously because you say oh well you know my interest
A: Ya I got Red-cross to to prove four years but apparently the the university isn't very interested because I got some other friends who did a lot better at their A levels which Red Cross took book as well and still didn't make it to in medical school so ya I suppose
B: So why did you go into law"
1728,"B: So why did you go into law
A: Uhm
B: How did you go into law then
A: Uh I thought on the strength of my English language competency lah
A: Ya
B: What do you mean by competency
A: No I mean it's like I I think I'm I'm I'm fairly comfortable with the English language so"
1729,"A: No I mean it's like I I think I'm I'm I'm fairly comfortable with the English language so
B: Written and oral
A: Written and oral written oral so uh well I mean if if if if if I am really lousy at the Sciences you know why don't I at least use some asset that I have which is competency in English so you know use it in in in in a field of study which which requires that kind of command
A: Uh uh I mean I I won't consider myself proficient lah because there are a lot of words which I still don't use don't know how to use don't know the meaning of so uh ya
B: What's your opinion now of this Singlish
B: Do you think that we should talk the way the other Singaporeans are talking or should we talk the way we have been uh taught and brought up to to to speak like a normal you know rofessional at work
A: Well I think it depends on the uh situation in which you use your language"
1730,"B: Like in my previous job I I still do get the opportunity to do so because of the Chinese-speaking uh population uh the manufacturers
A: You will deal with them uh
B: I deal with them I have to talk with them in their lingo although it is American Multinational
B: Uhm but now now that in the teaching profession very difficult unless I am teaching a Chinese class but I think that is uh a bit too difficult lah
A: Ya correct
B: In terms of our language ability to really teach the subject in Mandarin so to speak probably takes a while to really get a hang of it
A: Ya I know I got some"
1731,"B: And they are supposed to be writing in their English medium uh in exams or whatever projects and <unclear> word </unclear>
A: You know but in a sense I do sympathise with them because they say look you know what I mean
A: It's it's not that we want to how should I say it's it's to aid them in their understanding of the concept
A: Expression of course is another way lah but what is the concept they have this problem you see so I mean ya I I do agree lah that sometimes I wish I could use Chinese or you know but a lot of reservations

1748,"B: Okay I think uh I think maybe what do you think

1749,"A: Yes

B: What people think still happy <unclear> word </unclear>

A: Not really because they find that it's an achievement
B: Why is it that people wants to uhm buy expensive things

A: Okay you usually they buy
B: Or maybe have you ever felt that that the great sensation when you walked into the shop and you just pick something up without having to make sure you run through the whole town and look for the cheapest deal
A: So far I have I do not have that courage to do yet"
1751,"A: And motivating the the people who are listening to her and and uhm which is going against what she was preaching because she was actually supposed to
B: Motivate instead she ya
A: Motivate the students and failed I mean to talk about uhm sinking you see
A: So that's what the comments were lah
A: So what what did your lecturer say
B: In in fact uhm she didn't comment on the video
A: Then she went on straight on"
1752,"A: There was an activity
B: There there there was
A: No no lecture
B: Uhm we we have the activity lah yah because we have to so much time anyway only about half an hour
A: You know why because our lecturer was saying that uhm he said most of the time uh the local Singaporean uh students they are always uh remember she said in one of her lecture she said they are impress by those those lect those lecturers who uh who can entertain them
B: Entertain
A: And over and above you know the the content of his lectures so she says this is this one of the reasons uh why because uh she said you you can rest assured that this is one of the uh this these these are the kind of lectures that you can expect if you go overseas uh lectures and they do not take so much you know not like Singapore lecturers"
1753,"A: Yah exactly
A: I I mean there's that's way I I felt that the person who brought this issue out was rather childish
A: I would say to think to I mean to think that we need to be entertained in order to have uh lecture properly conducted that sort of thing because I felt that the content was what matters and it was really uhm uhm something that you know is she made use of materials that were easily obtainable daily life and newspapers and all that and I don't think you need to really entertain
A: Of course that will help but I think what what it boils to is uh yourself lah because we're talking about high-level students here
A: We're not talking about uhm lower level students uh I mean
B: We're suppose to be high-level thinkers yah
A: Yah they should think beyond just entertainment value and all that because I thought that that I was actually rather disappointed that they stopped the film halfway because I was just you know she was just getting into the uhm crucial part of it which is uhm you know ideas for activities"
1754,"A: So we tried to stick together
B: Oh yah I guess it's more comfortable with people you know but I I like the classes because she tries to give an example of what she wants us to be when actually teaching
B: Not like the others because I find some of them do uhm fail to practise what they preach
B: Ah well with all due respect to them
B: But somehow I wish those those lecturers in N U S went through this course
A: Ah yes
B: Because I I think there're a lot of mechanics they ought to know right how to uhm manage the O H T uhm a lot of other classroom mechanics which I thought would be helpful to them because now I'm looking back I felt find a lot of lecturers and tutors don't really know how to control a class and how to read the faces of pupils of of the students in in university"
1755,"B: Not like the others because I find some of them do uhm fail to practise what they preach
B: Ah well with all due respect to them
B: But somehow I wish those those lecturers in N U S went through this course
A: Ah yes
B: Because I I think there're a lot of mechanics they ought to know right how to uhm manage the O H T uhm a lot of other classroom mechanics which I thought would be helpful to them because now I'm looking back I felt find a lot of lecturers and tutors don't really know how to control a class and how to read the faces of pupils of of the students in in university
B: Because sometimes I just don't understand a lesson and I find uhm I'm really communicating with the tutor
B: You know he's supposed to make sure I understand my work"
1756,"A: Oh yah I think so too
B: Well anyway
A: Probably they will would have spared us all the lessons you know always of uh trying to find out what they're uh saying
B: Yah anyhow but I'm enjoying this course so far lah
B: How about yourself
A: Yah I'm enjoying myself but then
B: Not that not that I'm learning a lot"
1757,"A: Yah true
A: It's yah it's really like

B: That's right"
2724,"A: I don't think I've got it often enough
