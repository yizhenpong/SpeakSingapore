B: Uhm
A: Which I'm sure your have read
B: Uhm"
"A: That has not been settled
A: Of course unless the legislative said we leave it to the cases to decide I mean basically it's the Common Law that <unclear> word </unclear> that gives us law
A: Not really satisfactory but but you know there's been an entire range of dicta right
A: Some cases say well mercantile law's not the same as law merchant then you've got <unclear> word </unclear> <unclear> word </unclear> <unclear> word </unclear> and the and the earlier ones I mean <unclear> word </unclear> the whole range of definitions from mercantile law plus you see under Lord Dalton's approach this would not have been a problem at all because the law there would have meant English law
A: Okay but if you take the words with respect to those matters as having qualified the law with strictly to with strictly to mercantile law then again the definition of mercantile law becomes important you see which again is non-settlement yah but the law any problem Siew Hwa
A: The law with respect to those matters
A: Was it necessary"
"D: Well it seems that I think the amendments is trying to qualify that the law the law can be applied in Singapore
A: Okay so again you have two diff conflicting approaches under
A: You have to explain the problem
A: Lord Dalton's approach the whole law of English the whole of English sort of come in Atkins' approach only mercantile law does come in
A: So you've got two different approaches
A: Now again has that been settled by the <unclear> word </unclear> amendment
A: So divided the words with respect to this matter"
"A: Do you think that the two approaches are in conflict with one another
D: Yes
A: Do you think the approaches are conflicting enough
A: Think carefully I mean if you say that they are conflicting approaches fine uhm bear in mind except Lord Atkins says he does not disagree with Lord Dalton
A: Do you think they are conflicting approaches
A: You may argue they are conflicting in the sense that they lead to totally different results or someone may argue that well they're not really conflicting they are the same
A: It's just that the starting point of the entire thing is different which actually lead to different results but the approaches are itself not conflicting"
"A: The starting point actually <unclear> word </unclear>
A: You will say that that could mean that the approach is the same or one could equally argue <unclear> word </unclear> they're completely different
B: Oh
A: Right 'cos it leads to completely different results as in entire different way because that is not the way Lord Dalton will frame the issue of question law you know Lord Atkins frames it in a very different way I mean you can come to completely different results but you you don't have to sort of take what the book says is correct all the time
A: Okay okay uhm the law with respect to those matters
A: What used to come in and <unclear> word </unclear> the amendments up
A: David you said"
"A: Is he talking about an act which creates restrictions sanctions procedure and machinery
A: Is he talking about that <X>
A: Do you know what I mean

A: Yah okay so there are there are special newsletters for parents involve parents in <unclear> word </unclear> in school and future events and uh some achievements of students there and things like that lah okay
A: Uh as far I know <unclear> word </unclear> A-C-S has one Report Express
A: Not sure about other schools
A: Have you come across any"
"A: Another innovation came from John Cage C-a-g-e we spoke of them earlier who wrote very much for the prepared piano prepared piano in the nineteen forty where he had bolts screws spoons forks uh rubber eraser uh inserted in the strings to create a kind of percussion ensemble
A: Now of course you'll give instructions as to uh the pianist will reach for the inner key and play this this string or that string in a particular manner or fashion or to strike a string inside the keyboard rather than on the white key
A: These are new innovational techniques
A: Also uh popular were the new harmonics that were explored at this time
A: Techniques new harmonic and new techniques such as the increased use of flutter tongue technique in wind instrument
A: <unclear> word </unclear> you had chromatic clusters and all the voice the spoken word as well uhm as you can see the voice has to speak certain things indicated huh very syllabic words of vowels sometimes or whispered sounds or halfway between voice and speech question mark
C: Uhm uhm"
"A: Occasionally the instrumentalists were uh requested to say these sounds too to participate vocally rather than just playing
A: The percussion ensemble well increased in size as well and there was a a greater need for more exotic instruments that were being used
A: Instruments such as the gamalan uhm the gongs more Asian instruments that were used this time
A: For the sirens when <unclear> word </unclear> siren a fire instrument to be used in the ensemble could actually it's a pity we took the uhm projector from here lah
A: Uhm I made this transparency to show you the trends that took place in the nineteen after nineteen hundred okay
A: You can see we have experimental tradition right at the top nineteen twenties and we have mainstream okay
A: Mainstream we have people like Ravel in the mid composing alongside and then under experimental tradition we have composers such as Ives Shoenberg Webern <unclear> word </unclear> huh"
"A: So you see the tradition of the composers streaming ah taking opting for one route or the other but of course during the fifties uh it's a very experimental time and most composers dabbled at one or the other like Stockhausen's works uh Messiaen Babbit too and some of them would also write for non serial or chance music okay
A: Then we go on to Berio which I'll speak on briefly because uh I brought the CD along the songs for Cathy which Berio wrote for his wife Cathy Berberian B-e-r-b-e-r-i-a-n and I'll play the sequenza for you Sequenza Three for voice for his wife which he wrote in fifty six
A: Okay Luciano Berio B-e-r-i-o was born in nineteen twenty five in <unclear> word </unclear> nineteen twenty five <unclear> word </unclear>
A: He's a composer conductor and teacher and explored much theater music
A: He married uh the American singer Cathy Berberian in nineteen fifty whom he also wrote extensively for voice
A: He wrote nine sequenzas in all for various solo instruments piano the harp the trombone the voice and you see in his compositions the sequenzas uh a tendency to uhm have very theatrical features in it
A: For instance the sequenza five were trombone"
"A: You all settle down please
A: Alright the first assignment question was question five c
A: Okay I think most of you manage to do this question but some of you well I don't know what to say here ah but anyway this is the answer right
A: Now in the question five c you were asked whether a precipitate will form when the pH of a point 01 mole per dm cube solution of magnesium chloride is adjusted to ten
A: Now in the previous tutorial I gave you this hint right
A: The hint the key word is supposed to be pH ten
A: That means your solution is alkaline"
"A: That means your solution is alkaline
A: Alkaline meaning that there is an excess of OH minus for hydroxide ion so you have to calculate your concentration of hydroxide ion alright and you do this using your POH value okay
A: So your concentration for hydroxide will be ten to the power minus four mole per dm cube
A: Now why are you interested in this hydroxide ion concentration because there's a possibility that your NG two plus that comes from your magnesium chloride and your hydroxide can come together to form your white solid magnesium hydroxide as a precipitate okay
A: Right so you are not concerned about magnesium chloride your concentration of chloride ions
A: You're more concerned about these two okay
A: So you have a concentration of hydroxide"
"A: Alkaline meaning that there is an excess of OH minus for hydroxide ion so you have to calculate your concentration of hydroxide ion alright and you do this using your POH value okay
A: So your concentration for hydroxide will be ten to the power minus four mole per dm cube
A: Now why are you interested in this hydroxide ion concentration because there's a possibility that your NG two plus that comes from your magnesium chloride and your hydroxide can come together to form your white solid magnesium hydroxide as a precipitate okay
A: Right so you are not concerned about magnesium chloride your concentration of chloride ions
A: You're more concerned about these two okay
A: So you have a concentration of hydroxide
A: You have a concentration of <unclear> word </unclear>"
"A: Uhm some mistakes are you forgot to raise your OH minus expression to the power of two okay
A: Now anyway your ionic product will be this value which far exceeds your solubility product of magnesium hydroxide
A: Therefore you can compute that uh precipitate <unclear> word </unclear> four okay
A: So for question five c right you cannot say that since magnesium chloride is a soluble salt no precipitate formed
A: You have to bear uhm bear in mind that it is an alkaline solution alright
A: Any questions
A: No"
"A: Any questions
A: No
A: Okay question six question six right uhm for this one what you have is a saturated solution of hydrogen sulphide alright
A: Now you are given a specific concentration of metal ion and a specific concentration of hydrochloric acid okay
A: So your metal ion it's concentration equals to one mole per dm cube alright
A: Now your concentration of hydrochloric acid because this is a strong acid it will completely dissociate
A: So this will be equivalent to the amount of H plus that is present in solution which is zero point two five mole per dm cube okay"
"A: Okay question six question six right uhm for this one what you have is a saturated solution of hydrogen sulphide alright
A: Now you are given a specific concentration of metal ion and a specific concentration of hydrochloric acid okay
A: So your metal ion it's concentration equals to one mole per dm cube alright
A: Now your concentration of hydrochloric acid because this is a strong acid it will completely dissociate
A: So this will be equivalent to the amount of H plus that is present in solution which is zero point two five mole per dm cube okay
A: Right
A: Now what we have to do then is to calculate the sulphide ion concentration"
"A: Now for seven b there was some confusion alright
A: What you want to do is in this system that contains silver plus ion and chromate ion you want to dissolve HCL alright but you want to dissolve the HCL in such a way that you have a saturated solution but no precipitate will form
A: Now what is this precipitate that will form
A: The precipitate will be silver chloride
A: Okay because HCL will dissociate in solution to give you the ions alright
A: So what you have again like I always say it's soup of ion
A: Okay these two will not precipitate out just saturated"
"A: Okay because HCL will dissociate in solution to give you the ions alright
A: So what you have again like I always say it's soup of ion
A: Okay these two will not precipitate out just saturated
A: Now what you want to know is how much of this hydrochloric acid can I add such that these two can be present in solution and will not come up as a solid precipitate okay
A: Right
A: So most of you misunderstood the question you thought that oh it's a completely new system I'm using a new solution that contains just silver chloride
A: No"
"A: Okay these two will not precipitate out just saturated
A: Now what you want to know is how much of this hydrochloric acid can I add such that these two can be present in solution and will not come up as a solid precipitate okay
A: Right
A: So most of you misunderstood the question you thought that oh it's a completely new system I'm using a new solution that contains just silver chloride
A: No
A: Alright you're using the same solution as in part seven a with a new twist now your bubbly HCL into it alright
A: Okay so how do you calculate this part the maximum amount of HCL that can be added"
"A: No
A: Alright you're using the same solution as in part seven a with a new twist now your bubbly HCL into it alright
A: Okay so how do you calculate this part the maximum amount of HCL that can be added
A: First you need to calculate the maximum chloride concentration that can be dissolved alright and the only way you can do this is to equate this with Ksp for a saturated solution of silver chloride
A: Now where did you get this silver plus from Right silver plus from
A: Your original solution containing silver and chromate and ion right
A: Therefore your silver plus concentration is actually your answer to seven a okay"
"A: Your original solution containing silver and chromate and ion right
A: Therefore your silver plus concentration is actually your answer to seven a okay
A: Right
A: Most of you equate oh silver plus equals chloride so you just put s and s so it's s square equals to Ksp and you square it your whole expression you get your chloride concentration
A: No
A: Alright
A: That is actually misreading the question okay"
"A: No
A: Alright
A: That is actually misreading the question okay
A: So your silver plus concentration you get from part seven a and from this you can calculate your chloride concentration which is a very small value uh
A: Right seven point nine four times ten to the power of minus seven mole over dm cube Can you all see this
A: You all are speaking the answer is it Okay now for the next part alright uhm expressing your chloride in terms of concentration is not enough because the question asks you for the mass you know mass of HCL that can be dissolved in two hundred and fifty cm cube of the solution okay
A: So what you have to do is actually calculate the number of moles HCL that can be dissolved in two hundred and fifty cm cube alright"
"A: That is actually misreading the question okay
A: So your silver plus concentration you get from part seven a and from this you can calculate your chloride concentration which is a very small value uh

A: So what you have to do is actually calculate the number of moles HCL that can be dissolved in two hundred and fifty cm cube alright
A: Now you know that your chloride concentration is equivalent to your hydrochloric acid concentration
A: This is because hydrochloric acid will completely dissociate into ions okay"

A: Now you know that your chloride concentration is equivalent to your hydrochloric acid concentration
A: This is because hydrochloric acid will completely dissociate into ions okay
A: So therefore your HCL concentration will also be the same value right
A: And from there you use proportion to calculate the maximum mass of HCL in two hundred and fifty cm cube"
"A: You all are speaking the answer is it Okay now for the next part alright uhm expressing your chloride in terms of concentration is not enough because the question asks you for the mass you know mass of HCL that can be dissolved in two hundred and fifty cm cube of the solution okay

A: So therefore your HCL concentration will also be the same value right
A: And from there you use proportion to calculate the maximum mass of HCL in two hundred and fifty cm cube
A: Right you just divide the answer by four and multiply by the molecular mass of HCL you get a very small value okay"
"A: That's also AG plus concentration alright
A: So it's the number of moles in one dm cube
A: Yes yes
A: Ya oh no no no no if you read seven b ah what is the maximum mass of hydrogen chloride that can dissolve in two hundred and fifty cm cube of a saturated solution of silver chromate saturated solution of silver chromate and uh for seven b and seven a also saturated solution of silver chromate
A: So in both cases seven a and seven b one is one dm cube the other one is two hundred and fifty cm cube However both are saturated solution and therefore no matter what the volume you have for solution your concentration of silver plus is still is still the same because both solutions are the same it's just that you have different volumes of them <X>
A: However your number of moles of silver plus will be different There'll be more in the one thousand cm cube than in two hundred and fifty cm Concentration is different What No there is no dilution You don't transfer or what you just use the same solution and you just bubble in HCL that's all okay Alright Any other questions None </X> </I>"

"C: I think people will go out to vote if not for anything at least for Mr Goh
C: I've heard people saying I like Mr Goh I don't like the MP I don't know what to do but I'd rather vote with Mr Goh than take a gamble you know
A: Peter do you think in announcing a by-election in twelve to eighteen months Mr Goh has in fact undercut the strategy of the opposition <X>
A: I don't think so because uh you know the uh the uh the the bas the basic strength of the SDP's tactic in saying look let's fight this by-election is still there you know whether whether it's by-election now or by-election one and a half years from now so it's a it's a good move on the SDP and uh it's a it's a very uh compelling argument so we come back to the point of performance of the candidates and the party's performance so government must show must I think make uh recognise that uh one big factor is the Fanner's concept that people now have you know and the fact that government has reformed today you know it's going to make that an e even more important factor that you got to appear to be fair I like to take up a point that Bilveer raise which is that uh the issues are very different this tim eI think he's right on that score the issues are different but it does not make the election easier precisely because more people in the constituencies will be able to take the view well if we have a few more opposition members in parliament what is so wrong with that uh that's going to be a factor in this coming elections I think the other point that many people will have to consider would what kind of manifestos are the opposition parties coming up with the concept of gracious society is in a way within the PAP's manifesto I think unless the opposition is not conscious So are you saying then there really aren't any clear differences between the manifestos of the opposition and the PAP Bet you PAP will disagree with that But i would I would tend to say that the PAP have been very successful in hijacking many of the opposition parties' manifestos especially when it come to talking of uh the lower classes talking about the poorer people I think this caring compassionate society has been very successfully uh modelled on by Mr Goh and it's really I think going to deliver That's one I'm coming to the by-election strategy I think people are confused you know you have not run your GE you're already talking about your by-election That's one I think Number two it was mainly to overcome two basic arguments one was the SDP call for treating it as a by-election Number two was the J.B.J. problem and the fact that he chose to address it people amy argue that eh ther's something in it you know you just can't dismiss it as a ploy a tactic and I think people are beginning to think seriously about it and that that maybe this is an afterthought rather than really something thought through and that may in fact hurt Mr Goh in th long run Do you see the issues changing over the next ten days of the campaign you know anything can happen from Nomination Day to Polling Day but uh that's a a gen a general truth I would argue but uh my sense said i would not feel that fundamental of a change I think there will be basically quite low-key unless the opposition is able to come on with something out of their head But Mr Goh has draw has drawn the ground rules in the sense by pitting himself as the centre of this arena so it will be about mr Goh this time but perhaps uh longer run the worry will be a about Mr Goh's political role within the neighbourhood in uh ASEAN and so on the opposition parties need to come out more strongly with uh manifestos in respect of where they want Singapore go in the future Well I think it's not a manifesto bad backward all you know because the positions have have already closed uh closed closed up the the the uh endorsement of of mr Goh and uh I think he has a lot of goodwill and a lot of people will vote for him but that would that could be uh negated to some extent by local issues like constituencies and how the uh the candidates uh look because the uh I think Singaporeans become more sophisticated now they they do not accept the argument that unless I have a the PAP has a bigger mandate in percentage terms is going to be bad for the country so it's not that black and white lah Now while though the local issues are important at this particular time in point somehow or another they have been made quite insignificant by the fact that there is a call and the call is where does Mr Goh stand not just now maybe in the next decade or so I think that's very pressing well the last election was described as a watershed election now if you had to describe this one in just one word what would you say Peter we'll start with you Turning point Legitimacy Mr Goh's election Thank you gentlemen for your views well tomorrow the hustings begin with political rallies and dialogue sessions the campaign will continue for nine days after which you decide who to give your vote to good night </X> </I>"

A: Weng Hee as a married man do you think that his points are valid
C: Yes basically I would agree with what Terry has said but I'd like to add on and say that Singaporeans these days aspire to a standard of living characterized by material comfort and a lot of independence a lot of freedom and as a result they now perceive marriage as an institution which will impose on their financial well-being and on their independence

A: No further questions my Lord
C: Now Miss Sng
C: You said that you knew the Plaintiff as Mister Shaw as the project manager and system designer
C: Did you know whether he was a director or partner or employee of the company Datatronics"
"A: Of Datatronics
A: I'm sorry
A: Because
A: Oh thank you my Lord
C: So he could have been the owner of the company
C: He could have been the owner of the company as far as they were concerned
C: Yes my Lord"
"A: Oh thank you my Lord
C: So he could have been the owner of the company
C: He could have been the owner of the company as far as they were concerned
C: Yes my Lord
C: When you appointed Datatronics first
C: Yes
B: I will assume he was"
"B: Not a big difference
B: The only company that we invited to provide a quotation was C S A Computer Systems Advisers
C: But the difference was still enough for you to appoint Datatronics
C: Yes my Lord
C: Much obliged
C: Yes my Lord
C: Not as much as that but that they had to be competitive initially so that very little profits were made when they gave quotations"
"C: But the difference was still enough for you to appoint Datatronics
C: Yes my Lord
C: Much obliged
C: Yes my Lord
C: Not as much as that but that they had to be competitive initially so that very little profits were made when they gave quotations
C: When Mister Shaw had left the company in nineteen eighty-two you only consulted him informally
B: Yes"
"A: Doctor Ang you said you prepared the Preliminary Report sometime after you had seen the Accused
B: Yes my Lords
A: You have a copy of the report with you
B: Yes
B: It is dated third of September eighty-seven is it"
"B: It is dated third of September eighty-seven is it
A: Have you made extra copies
B: No
A: I have extra copies my Lords
A: These were given to us at the commencement of the trial
A: Preliminary Report one hundred and twenty-six my Lords
A: Doctor this report was made on the third of September nineteen eighty-six"
"B: No
A: I have extra copies my Lords
A: These were given to us at the commencement of the trial
A: Preliminary Report one hundred and twenty-six my Lords
A: Doctor this report was made on the third of September nineteen eighty-six
A: Is that right
B: Nineteen eighty-seven"
"B: Yes arising from those conditions
B: Arising from the rest of the developments and so on
A: One essential difference between your initial report and your final report was that when you prepared the final report P one hundred and eighteen you had by then the evidence adduced at the trial
B: Yes my Lords
A: And you specifically mentioned it in paragraph B of P one hundred and eighteen
B: Yes my Lords
A: Now Doctor Ang at that time when you prepared the Preliminary Report"
"A: One essential difference between your initial report and your final report was that when you prepared the final report P one hundred and eighteen you had by then the evidence adduced at the trial
B: Yes my Lords
A: And you specifically mentioned it in paragraph B of P one hundred and eighteen
B: Yes my Lords
A: Now Doctor Ang at that time when you prepared the Preliminary Report
A: On what basis did you consider whether or not there was any abnormality of mind
B: On the basis of the history that he gave me"
"B: Yes
B: I agree fully
A: That anybody reading your report would have a serious gap in the nature of the case and the nature of the evidence and the nature of the testimony that transpired
B: But the outcome of the case is to be decided by the Lordships not by any person reading it
A: Yes I agree
A: I will come to why you said that
A: But anybody reading this will probably conclude that no such thing ever happened in this Court"
"B: Yes
A: Do you think it is fair for you to make a report like this
B: No
B: I think the report reflects my opinion on the matter and I'll be giving evidence in Court before the Lordships
B: So anything could always be raised
A: Doctor Ang you earlier said that page one hundred and eighteen reflects your opinion
B: Yes my conclusions"
"B: Yes my conclusions
B: It reflects my conclusions
A: On the testimony that was given in Court
B: Yes my Lords
A: Is it fair therefore a central issue to be ignored by you
B: I never ignored it
B: It was considered"
"B: That's right
B: In fact very briefly I described I did not go into great details and I think what matters most was my conclusion and I would be answerable to the Court to explain how I came to such a conclusion
B: Now whether a person outside reading it is aware of the whole proceedings or not I don't think it really matters Coomaraswamy:-
A: May it please your Lordship <X>
A: Now Doctor please refer to page three of P one hundred and eighteen your final report under the heading of Antecedents to the Incident
A: Have you got it
B: Yes my Lord"

A: Now Doctor please refer to page three of P one hundred and eighteen your final report under the heading of Antecedents to the Incident
A: Have you got it
B: Yes my Lord
A: Doctor by this you meant it is your account as to the events leading to the incident

A: So you're just going to contribute into the pool lah or something like that"
"B: I think just handling less currency that is all lah but
A: Oh

B: Ya lor
A: Doesn't matter lor
C: Ya lah but roughly you would say okay about five hundred for this currency
A: But maximum two thousand right
C: Ya
B: Because if we if we calculate now we can roughly gauge like the closest to five hundred"
"A: Divide by
B: Multiply by
A: Divide by 0 nine
A: About there lor
B: Thousand two 0
A: one two zero six guilders
B: So either you can get one two 0 0 guilders or just a round up figure or a thousand guilders"
"A: I don't know I don't know what they have
C: You must try and get
B: Oh it doesn't matter
B: Ya lor it it could be
C: Ya lah in <unclear> word </unclear>
B: ten smaller <unclear> word </unclear>
A: Okay"

B: Thirty-one
A: Yes
A: It is also near the left nipple"
"C: Sorry the picture is not very clear

A: Yes my Lord
A: What I want to confirm is the time of death Doctor Wee
A: Where did you get the information from
C: This information was given to us on the police three zero three report"
"B: <unclear> word </unclear> Let me collect my thoughts okay
A: Uh maybe I maybe I
B: Ya
A: Would just run through a bit about the background lah
B: Uhm
A: Uh
B: Ya ya"
"A: Uh
B: Ya ya
A: Essentially
B: Okay lah
A: I've some coverage
B: Uhm
A: Right uhm and I have been approached several time by different people about uh"
"B: Uhm
A: And I've also seen the several uh uh advertisement on the papers
B: Uhm
A: plus also mails lah
B: Uhm
A: that talk about uh that focuses on uhm low premium but uh having uh
B: Uhm"
"B: Uhm
A: Uh but uh it's not something that's for saving versus the life type that is both uh
B: Uhm
A: Coverage protecting protection and also saving lah
B: Yep
A: That that seems to be the difference to me
B: So that's the main diff but"
"A: Ya ya
B: Huh
A: They are riders yes
B: They they they're sort of uh composite lah
A: But they're I don't have uh rider alone type if if you if you see what I'm talking about
B: Uhm how old are they
A: Just about maybe about two years I think"
"B: Uhm how old are they
A: Just about maybe about two years I think
B: You mean you took them together one after the other
A: They uh sort of almost lah
B: Two years old lah
A: Uhm uhm
B: Okay so that's an endowment"
"A: Just about maybe about two years I think
B: You mean you took them together one after the other
A: They uh sort of almost lah
B: Two years old lah
A: Uhm uhm
B: Okay so that's an endowment
A: What is the typical uh range of coverage normally for most most most people"
"A: Uhm
B: If you have you know great visions for your sons and <unclear> word </unclear> them for post-graduate or whatever
A: Uhm
B: You know you will have to <unclear> word </unclear> for more lah
A: Okay okay
B: Uhm which which are the adverts you like
A: I think there was the latest one I receive is uh CIGNA"
"B: From the protection only insurance you want know about it or are you in the position to say Yes I think I need more insurance but I want to get maximum protection for minimum amount only
A: Uhm
B: What's your state of mind right now
A: Uh I'm just trying to explore uh what are the various offerings uh in terms of protection only
B: Uhm
A: and and then maybe make an assessment whether I can afford or I can't afford
B: Ah okay let me just run through quickly"
"A: and and then maybe make an assessment whether I can afford or I can't afford
B: Ah okay let me just run through quickly
A: Uhm
B: Uhm they come in many names lah okay
A: Oh
B: Basically there're of a temporary nature
A: Uhm"
"A: Uhm
B: Okay
A: Uhm
B: But it it's it's generally either one or the other lah
A: Uhm
B: Okay
B: Uhm it's the main difference is whether you want to ensure that it does its job or not"
"B: So these premiums are very low
A: Uhm
B: and they couple it with one that's only for limited period
B: They can bring down the premiums lah
A: Uhm
B: Okay
B: Uhm what else do you need to know"
"A: Okay
B: Okay
B: Uh what else do they have
B: I think that's basically it lah
B: It's it's only in the packaging
A: Uhm
B: Uhm I don't know whether"
"A: Uhm
B: how you you are the how the cheapest in the market go for it type or what
A: Uh
B: Rough overview lah
B: That's all I can think of right now
A: Ya ya okay
A: Uhm for this how difficult is it to claim"
"B: That's all I can think of right now
A: Ya ya okay
A: Uhm for this how difficult is it to claim
B: Uhm not difficult lah
A: Not difficult because I understand there were some there there're some medical terminology involved
A: It doesn't mean that you have a pain in the heart then you know that's it uh
B: I've spoken to our doctors"
"A: It doesn't mean that you have a pain in the heart then you know that's it uh
B: I've spoken to our doctors
A: Uhm
B: normal doctors lah which are on our med panel
A: Uh
B: They think it's a fair definition
A: Is that right"
"A: Of course
B: that's just <unclear> word </unclear> so
A: Okay
B: Uhm these tend to be more popular nowadays lah
A: Uhm
B: being a more affluent society
A: Ya"
"A: Right right right
B: So if if your folks or if your parents are not alive and they suf they died of cancer and all
A: Uhm
B: it might be a minus lah
A: Uhm
B: from the underwriting point
A: Okay So the advantage of this is that it gives you protection uhm however <unclear> word </unclear>"
"A: Uhm
B: from the underwriting point
A: Okay So the advantage of this is that it gives you protection uhm however <unclear> word </unclear>
B: It's on a temporary nature lah
B: The the one thing the advantage is actually the cost lah
A: Ya
B: What normally what we do when we propose is we normally package it with a savings type policy"
"B: from the underwriting point
A: Okay So the advantage of this is that it gives you protection uhm however <unclear> word </unclear>
B: It's on a temporary nature lah
B: The the one thing the advantage is actually the cost lah
A: Ya
B: What normally what we do when we propose is we normally package it with a savings type policy
A: Uhm"
"A: Oh okay
B: Uhm but most of them don't
A: Uh huh
B: Uh so you would you're actually paying and paying and paying lah
A: Is that right
B: as opposed to a savings policy where effectively your savings and you're offsetting the premiums through the years
A: Oh uh huh"
"B: there's no loss
A: I see I see okay
B: Uhm
A: so all the interest lah
B: Ya but there's I think there's a offsetting along the way Finally catch up
A: Is that right
B: There is a small cost involved in insurance"
"A: Uhm
B: so that the insurance part is actually thirty dollars
A: Right
B: But hundred and twenty would actually go into savings lah
A: <unclear> word </unclear> Uh huh
B: if you look at it from that point of view
A: Uhm uhm okay"
"A: <unclear> word </unclear> Uh huh
B: if you look at it from that point of view
A: Uhm uhm okay
B: Okay That's what I meant lah
A: Uhm </X> </I>"
"B: Okay I I stop payment or the premium and this and I let the policy goes on so this is the uh uh coverage isn't it
A: Okay paid up means that okay at any time uh any one year if you want to stop paying alright if you get that in cash it's going to be very much less than what you're going to get alright
A: So if you opt for pay up means that you know
B: The policy will still run lah
A: It will still down anytime down the years let's say ten years later
A: If you opt for a pay up at tenth time even is uh twenty years down the road it will still pay you that particular value
A: Ya for example if let's say at the tenth year you opt for pay up which is eleven thousand so another ten years down the road okay you will only they will only eleven thousand if something happen to you"
"A: It's just no it's up to thirtieth of November but of course uh don't wait until the last minute because uh it may be some complication who knows
B: You think something like Telecoms rush
A: Ya ya ya you'd be surprised you know
B: No lah what Telecoms rush
B: You won't have another Telecoms rush
A: No what I mean of course not
A: But what I'm trying to say is that okay give us two weeks you know because maybe you need a medical check-up you know"
"B: I thought you were doing pretty well
A: Uhm I it was more for the long term but uh right now is running into difficulties because of all these extension
B: Oh I see
B: In that case you maybe you have expanded uh uh over expanded lah over the last last last two three years
A: Maybe a bit too fast lah
B: I see I see
B: Well anyway this is not the you are not the only customer"
"A: Uhm I it was more for the long term but uh right now is running into difficulties because of all these extension
B: Oh I see
B: In that case you maybe you have expanded uh uh over expanded lah over the last last last two three years
A: Maybe a bit too fast lah
B: I see I see
B: Well anyway this is not the you are not the only customer
B: In fact I was just visiting two other customers yesterday at the somewhere around here Jurong and uh ya everybody looks like they have some problem here and there"
"A: Right
B: Ya what what do you see of Indonesia
B: Do you think Indonesia would be a would be of any help if they of any help to business or not if they really win over the elections and a more stable government is uh in place
A: Uh I think it is going to take time lah with all the violence going around there
A: I I think is going even when a stable government is uh elected I think it's still going to take years lah
B: Well very sad man
B: I mean as banker we uh we always hear this kind of comments make us jittery man Anyway thanks for your uh uh allowing us to come by to visit you today"
"B: Ya what what do you see of Indonesia
B: Do you think Indonesia would be a would be of any help if they of any help to business or not if they really win over the elections and a more stable government is uh in place
A: Uh I think it is going to take time lah with all the violence going around there
A: I I think is going even when a stable government is uh elected I think it's still going to take years lah
B: Well very sad man
B: I mean as banker we uh we always hear this kind of comments make us jittery man Anyway thanks for your uh uh allowing us to come by to visit you today
B: Actually uh uh we just want to come up to update with you uh as in our all annual exercises lah"
"A: I I think is going even when a stable government is uh elected I think it's still going to take years lah
B: Well very sad man
B: I mean as banker we uh we always hear this kind of comments make us jittery man Anyway thanks for your uh uh allowing us to come by to visit you today
B: Actually uh uh we just want to come up to update with you uh as in our all annual exercises lah
B: To to update with you how is business and then we will also want to discuss a little regarding your credit facilities
B: I think you have known uh if you have read the papers uh over the past few months uh in fact the local banks uh we are actually quite heavy laden with the with non-performing loans
B: So Sad to say but uh because of all these we are actually uh forced in certain ways to re-look into all the credit facilities granted to our customers so I think that is basically my objection my my objective today"
"B: Ya have to reduce
B: Ah so I know it is a bit difficult given the uh I mean just now like what you say about times are bad and all that but we really really have to come up you know today to tell you basically these are some of the intention that the bank is adopting
A: But but my business is already so bad and I really have some strict cash flow problem and all my facilities in this factory is being stretched to the maximum already and how can you come to me and tell me that you need to reduce my O D line some more
A: I just don't know lah
A: I really don't know
B: Uh but actually what we can do is that we we uh we understand your problem but we really hope that Mr Tan you could understand the position we are in lah
B: Although a lot of time people say that you know banks are you know during rainy days uh we will take away the umbrella"
"A: But but my business is already so bad and I really have some strict cash flow problem and all my facilities in this factory is being stretched to the maximum already and how can you come to me and tell me that you need to reduce my O D line some more
A: I just don't know lah
A: I really don't know
B: Uh but actually what we can do is that we we uh we understand your problem but we really hope that Mr Tan you could understand the position we are in lah
B: Although a lot of time people say that you know banks are you know during rainy days uh we will take away the umbrella
B: But I hope you all can understand that uh we are also quite badly hit ah
B: Property value have all drop and all that"
"B: Property value have all drop and all that
B: In fact all the all the case in fact ninety percent of our cases uh in our portfolio actually to use the term very crudely we are actually all underwater
B: We are all struggling so we we understand we also understand your O D has been used up to the hilt and then at certain times also you actually went over the limit but uh we are trying to see whether we can do a restructure
B: We are not trying to say we want to bring it back down to two hundred lah you know within twenty-four hours
B: We are looking at a maybe a restructured payment say maybe five thousand per month something like that
B: Something that you are comfortable with hor and then at least uh you know we could use this as a tool and then to tie tide over this period of time
B: For all you know five thousand you know a month over over one year we are looking at only sixty thousand"
"B: So if that is the case then I would suggest is that uh but coming back to the point again it is five I mean it is like what I said
B: We are not looking at two hundred thousand although this is uh you know the initial idea that head office has imposed on your account but I am looking at a maybe on gradual basis what about five thousand per month
B: Do you think you can manage with that for the time being
B: So every month we reduce by five thousand lah so over a period of one year we are looking at sixty thousand because if that is OK then maybe again I cannot promise you this is this is only uh a decision on my end here
B: It may be approved it may not be approved
B: But I want to have I want to work out something that is more comfortable so long as you are comfortable I think that is more important
B: At the end of the day you don't over commit yourself to the bank and then if you are something that you are comfortable you can fulfil I think that is more important"
"B: Within a week's time and then we see how we go from there
B: If really you have any problem then what we do is that after six months okay we will come back to you again and well we can sit down and then discuss further then
B: I mean let us hope that the economy will recover by then because right now the biggest problem that we have is that we actually uh sitting on a lot of properties like for example these factories that you have now uh last year when I came in it was something like three point five million and then today we are looking at two million so straightaway we are looking at a negative network of about one point five million so this is the biggest headache that we are facing
B: So I think not a problem lah
B: Don't worry
B: I mean I will come to you in say one week's time and then we see how we go from there
A: What about your bank"
"B: Oh banks we are affected we are affected
B: Uh in fact if you if you read the uh annual reports of all the local banks we are making hefty provision for the industries so we are badly hit
B: We are badly hit
B: So you know we are not spared lah
B: Okay we are not spared lah
A: Uhm nice to know that I am not alone in all this
B: You are not spared okay"
"B: Uh in fact if you if you read the uh annual reports of all the local banks we are making hefty provision for the industries so we are badly hit
B: We are badly hit
B: So you know we are not spared lah
B: Okay we are not spared lah
A: Uhm nice to know that I am not alone in all this
B: You are not spared okay
B: We are all business uh private organisations we are not spared but we have to be prudent huh like living in Singapore we have to be prudent"
"A: Uhm nice to know that I am not alone in all this
B: You are not spared okay
B: We are all business uh private organisations we are not spared but we have to be prudent huh like living in Singapore we have to be prudent
B: We have to again uh we have to protect the interest of our share-holders, depositors and all that lah but uh well never mind we see how it will it goes
B: More important I think we want to see that we can help our local enterprise here to ride through this bad times which is the reason why I have said we are always open for discussion although the intention is to reduce your OD limit by two hundred thousand but I think we can always look into a restructured payment
B: Five thousand if it is too difficult for you we try it for six months
B: After six months if you really have problems come back to us OK our doors are open anytime"

A: You still have
A: They have a dimmer system also
B: They don't"
"B: But I think even if they don't have the dimmer system

A: The lights won't have any effects lah
B: Ya
A: Especially it's a school-hall

B: Oh oh
A: Neglect your education and all that
A: And the that if you were to decide to leave"
"A: Neglect your education and all that
A: And the that if you were to decide to leave
B: And you've a degree
A: What you're doing now you can always fall back on your degree and on teaching with with say <unclear> word </unclear> lah
B: She said that ah
A: Ya
A: But then I was thinking that MOE may not find that very very flattering that you consider it like you know if everything else fails then you fall back on teaching"
"A: But then I was thinking that MOE may not find that very very flattering that you consider it like you know if everything else fails then you fall back on teaching
B: <unclear> word </unclear>
A: When I saw that I saw that that line I said
A: Is this <unclear> word </unclear> okay good lah not not too bad
A: That that one line uh
A: If I was MOE and interview
A: Oh I see"
"A: That that one line uh
A: If I was MOE and interview
A: Oh I see
B: Go and tell to MOE lah
B: You got no choice okay
A: You want you take
B: Ya"
"A: That means you join the Ministry and dance like inspector for dance kind of thing
A: Then you go around the schools and things
B: I wouldn't mind
A: If you like uh maybe you should explore that area rather than go into teaching
A: Because I tell you uh you may enjoy teaching very much now but whether you really want to start teaching Geography
B: Have you tried
B: Have you have you prepared this speech to me before <unclear> word </unclear>"
"A: Ya they become teachers first
A: But then MOE also have a scheme where they bring in professionals that come in you know directly and then teach dance like in in uh NTU they
B: And damn tiring to teach dance you know
B: I find I don't know lah
B: I find need
A: It could be very tiring
B: I find it very"
"A: <unclear> word </unclear> No that's why what I meant was that uhm if you you want dance to in a sense uh complement what
B: What I do
A: What you do right rather than it being the main thing <unclear> word </unclear>
A: But then you find that uh I don't know lah
A: I I've seen a lot of people who've gone into teaching and then find that they can spare time later to do dance or whatever
A: You find that it drains you so much that you will not benefit <unclear> word </unclear>
B: Ya it's true"
"B: But I mean idealistically speaking I just want to get money and and studying dance somewhere
B: That's idealistically and and like not even wanting to come back and work and hold some kind of responsible position I I
A: Great
B: Good lah
B: But wish but that's not my primary concern right now I mean like
A: You never you would never consider going say joining say SDT or it's very <unclear> word </unclear> lifestyle
B: If I come out <X>"
"A: With experiments
B: Ya and create something
B: So I don't know whether whether I'll call myself a choreographer first or a dancer first
B: But the thing I wanna call myself I don't know I <unclear> word </unclear> I don't know what you call it lah
B: But I I like I find my greatest joy uhm sharing whatever things I have with others <unclear> word </unclear> which is actually teaching </X> </I>"
"A: We'll be the frontline
B: Ya
A: For all all the <unclear> word </unclear>
B: I I I'm not so sure exactly how they're going to uh divide the work lah but from what I know it's uhm uhm people like Diane myself Shuefen
B: They all will be doing development work and then when users have problem they won't call us directly they will call I don't know who from your side would be but I think you're one of them uhm when the printer got problem they call you
A: You mean you mean normal problem
A: What I'm referring to is those uhm as I said uh the accounting system you know"
"B: Uh the interface uh
A: Solve the the minor minor problems we'll solve
A: But when it comes to a more the more specialised programmes we'll look you'll look into that
B: Ya I think for you guys uh I think you'll still be involved in some development work lah
B: But I think most of the time you're attending to user
A: I hope not because it's supposed to be twenty twenty per cent the most
B: Ha"
"A: Uhm you mean oh assessing to the database is it
B: Ah
A: Of course that is that's where all the records are stored
B: All these while you're working on this system lah
A: Yes yes but of course the system sort of like retrieve and manipulates the data in the database
A: By the way uh Weiying is supposed to back me up
B: Who"
"A: It's just like physically uh changing office now
A: Job wise also change
B: Because actually uh you know I'm also working on this exam mark entry system right
B: Actually this one is done by done by a staff quite sometime ago lah and then a William took over and now I was ask to look into it further and
A: Further you mean enhancement
B: Ya maybe got to rewrite the whole thing lah
A: Why"
"B: Because actually uh you know I'm also working on this exam mark entry system right
B: Actually this one is done by done by a staff quite sometime ago lah and then a William took over and now I was ask to look into it further and
A: Further you mean enhancement
B: Ya maybe got to rewrite the whole thing lah
A: Why
B: Because ah because we're facing a lot of problems
B: We our there are a lot of departments using it and then they're all over the campus"
"B: And then one once they call up complain that there's a problem
B: We can't solve it on the spot we have to go down so it takes a lot of our time
B: So we're trying to find out ways to cut down on all this travelling
A: Uhm uhm that means more or less cut down on maintenance lah
B: Ya ya especially ya this thing is only used during exam time lah so
A: Once
B: During this period"
"B: We can't solve it on the spot we have to go down so it takes a lot of our time
B: So we're trying to find out ways to cut down on all this travelling
A: Uhm uhm that means more or less cut down on maintenance lah
B: Ya ya especially ya this thing is only used during exam time lah so
A: Once
B: During this period
A: Once a year that sort of thing"
"A: Once a year that sort of thing
B: Ya and uh and also for me during this period uh is the the account section
B: They're having their year-end closing so it's a lot of work at us at the same time
B: So this one got to look into it lah
B: I'm currently looking into ways to improve and uh cut down on the the travelling
A: Improving uh by adding on or changing the system or to cut completely new you know
A: language or whatever"
"A: I mean you'll be learning a lot of new things
B: Ya
A: I think you find it quite interesting uhm
B: Ya uh I was telling my boss lah to use it as a as a learning platform
B: That's very good because if you were to move into client server next time we need to start off with some simple project uhm
B: We need to start off with some prototypes so that we can iron out
B: We can avoid uhm committing some serious uhm mistakes in uh in the real system you see so this is a a a good application to start off with lah"
"B: Ya uh I was telling my boss lah to use it as a as a learning platform

B: We need to start off with some prototypes so that we can iron out
B: We can avoid uhm committing some serious uhm mistakes in uh in the real system you see so this is a a a good application to start off with lah
B: So uhm but if you were to develop purely for saving time one then I think this is not the right approach ah probably adding or modifying the existing programme is better
B: Ah so so let's talk about more your work
A: My my work uh"
"A: They change things uh now and then you see with new subjects you see with new subjects and so on coming in
A: So that requires a lot of changes to the system and that keeps me very busy ya
B: And on top of that you still got to support what Word Perfect
A: Uhm those are normal uh user supports lah located a a couple faculties to take I mean to take care of all the secretaries and so on for the O A System and general PC problem
B: Actually uh actually is quite interesting and quite good to have exposure to to do some uhm PC work
B: Uh if it is just purely mainframe then it's quite boring at times
A: Uh quite true because mainframe seems that there are much more restrictions than PCs"
"B: Maybe there's no more upgrade anymore or what
B: I'm not so sure
A: You mean it's a dead
B: Ya ya but it's working lah
B: Future enhancement
B: Probably there isn't any
A: Oh I see so you're looking into vendor <unclear> word </unclear> that is growing"
"B: Uhm no
A: Just
B: Actually even in Personnel also the requirement can be very very high because you're talking about storing uhm uhm all documents you know belonging to each staff belonging to student
B: So when you apply for a job and then your resume your application form everything this probably got to be stored electronically lah
B: So by scanning in as an image and uh uh storing on uhm secondary storage devise
A: Like what like what CD-Rom
B: Optical disc"
"B: Optical disc
A: Optical disc
B: Ya it's something called Optical Judebox and that stores many optical disks but then these are very very expensive
B: So currently we are just looking into it lah
A: So what's the chances how's the chance like
B: Uh with that like of budget we have I think it's quite difficult to get uh a a very sophisticated system lah
B: We're just looking into the <unclear> word </unclear> feasibility lah and not not the actual product yet"
"B: Ya it's something called Optical Judebox and that stores many optical disks but then these are very very expensive

B: We're just looking into the <unclear> word </unclear> feasibility lah and not not the actual product yet
B: And also the user side has not identified exactly what should be <unclear> word </unclear> archive into into uh uh computerised system
B: So that's why I these days I have to call up a lot of vendor <X>"
"B: So currently we are just looking into it lah

B: I got a lot of meeting go for a lot of seminars"
"B: So that's why I these days I have to call up a lot of vendor <X>
B: I got a lot of meeting go for a lot of seminars
A: Is for this purpose
B: Which is quite interesting lah
A: Oh oh oh I thought all the while is current server
B: Current server also
B: That one is looking into uh Oracle Database Diane and myself lah"
"B: Which is quite interesting lah
A: Oh oh oh I thought all the while is current server
B: Current server also
B: That one is looking into uh Oracle Database Diane and myself lah
A: I thought it's Informix
B: Previously we're looking at Informix and Oracle plus some hardware
B: But uhm you know there's this task force current server task force so they delegate the work lah"
"B: That one is looking into uh Oracle Database Diane and myself lah
A: I thought it's Informix
B: Previously we're looking at Informix and Oracle plus some hardware
B: But uhm you know there's this task force current server task force so they delegate the work lah
B: So actually we're not in the task force but I don't why I got this got to do this also
B: Diane and myself we got task to look into Oracle
B: Interesting"
"B: Yes
A: Uhm again in the long run is is
B: Cheaper actually ya because you can store a lot more
A: So it really depends on how much data you have lah
A: Whether you real it's really necessary to get
B: Correct
A: Optical disk"
"A: So this is the next stage
B: Ya the voice test is very fun
B: The voice test very fun
A: That means after this no more lah
A: Two rounds
B: I think if you get short listed again you go for the interview
A: Uh that's right that's right"
"B: I think if you get short listed again you go for the interview
A: Uh that's right that's right
B: Ya because for the NUS one I went for the written test as well
A: So terrible lah
B: They say you are short listed for English test so you go you write a essay and a and a and a formal letter to invite Mr X to come here for a Stress Management Workshop something like that
A: Uh
B: Because it's uh administrative assistant for extra"
"B: Department of Extra-mural Studies
B: Just like you know like outside courses
A: Ya ya
B: Those are extra-mural lor
B: So I I didn't know what's extra-mural
B: I just know that I'm qualified for it then I applied

"A: Ya at least you've a chance you see uhm
B: Ya
A: I've got a friend uh I don't know how many companies she wrote into you know and then not one interview
B: Ya lor
A: Yet
B: The thing is that I don't have enough interviews
B: But what what is her qualification"
"A: Yet
B: The thing is that I don't have enough interviews
B: But what what is her qualification
A: Uh just a Bachelor degree ya
B: Ya lor
B: Honours is nothing unless you you you can get a job
B: Then you earn a bit more something like that"
"B: The thing is that I don't have enough interviews
B: But what what is her qualification
A: Uh just a Bachelor degree ya
B: Ya lor
B: Honours is nothing unless you you you can get a job
B: Then you earn a bit more something like that
B: I'm not sure"
"A: I I thought just go for interview
A: I mean from there they can judge what
B: But at least voice test they must hear you
A: Over the ya lah
B: <unclear> word </unclear> I'm sort of expected a voice test but written test like <unclear> word </unclear>
B: For my friend she just she was just applying for programmer you know like you slot in programmes and then you've to go a test also
B: They have English one and Chinese one"
"B: Then I try which one I get in

"B: We we got to know about their projects uhm the outcome why they choose the projects the type of methodology they use the philosophical underpinnings etcetera
B: So how then
B: How you gonna present yours
A: I haven't actually think about it but from what yesterday the impression is that uh there's not much of questions being posed to the presenters lah and I personally hope that the presenters and the teacher might not take it might not take questions uhm too personally
A: I mean not as an attack uh personal attack or something like that
A: It's just a purely academic enquiry something like that
A: So it will be more interesting in that sense lah because actually there's a lot of uh things that I wanted to ask lah but judging from the face of the presenter I dare not lah because they might think otherwise you see"

A: So that is the thing you know
B: And I guess the other problem is that it deals with Physical Geography and it's not our line so call so we may not be able to to to discuss the issue in greater depth and in detail and also we may not know that issues in
A: You didn't take Physical Geog"
"A: It's just a
B: Ya ya
A: Part of the grading
A: It's not the whole of the grading you see so you shouldn't be bog down to anxiety or you know being not able to answer the questions but must take it in the positive light lah positive spirit that's the whole thing
A: Then there's a lively discussion nah not a very quiet session just a presenter doing his job or something
B: But I guess it I guess the topic dealt with is Physical so no people really bother or they don't know they're not in the line to to ask questions so I guess when it comes to the later portion
A: Ya maybe the Human"
"A: So what are you gonna to do with it
B: Okay I I agree in that area but thank goodness on my case is that the number of replied are quite equal meaning that I have the number of form which I wanted so I'm quite happy with it in that sense but I would prefer more you see
B: Usually like for example under one category only have one or two replied form instead of four or five ya so when it's one or two it would represent the whole you see so that is what I'm worried but as long as I'm able to get something is better than nothing
A: If when you do surveys is normally the case lah unless you do informal surveys over the telephone or doing a tape recording like this then you won't have the problem of surveys not coming back nah
B: The only problem is that you must get to allow you tape the voices to allow you for such interview
A: Basically a behavioural approach approach uhm mine is essential texture it's a post-modern challenge and geographical approach
A: Uh basically I'll be looking at the heminetical aspect that means in terms of uh interpreting language"
"B: The only problem is that you must get to allow you tape the voices to allow you for such interview

A: The text here shall refer to the newspapers lah that of my main source of information for it
A: Uhm I'll be looking at environmental issues as contain in the newspaper uh time series analysis of four years
B: Why environment is is there any other
A: It's geographical in a sense because the approach is looking at text the newspapers as text and it's geographical because we are looking at environment"
"B: Why environment is is there any other
A: It's geographical in a sense because the approach is looking at text the newspapers as text and it's geographical because we are looking at environment
B: Okay
A: Ya how how the media especially the the Malay newspapers has been instrumental in in so-called instilling a sense of environmental awareness amongst the community lah
A: So that that is so you can call it a hypothesis so so to say uhm in terms of environmental awareness among the Malay community
A: Why did <unclear> word </unclear> the role of media has been positive positive or otherwise
A: So basically that's it lah and the research thing has been going rather slow and it's brilliant"

B: It's takes quite a lot of time ya
A: Because you're dealing with not one or two newspapers what you're dealing with four years you know four years and that's three hundred and sixty-five times four
A: Over such a short period of few months and having a lot of other things to do I wish I could have done more lah in the sense because there are other areas that is worth looking lah in terms of what let's say production of production and consumption of environmental meanings because right now uh what I'm dealing with is under consumption part how the the the readers specially the Malay community so called decode uh interpret the what is written in the newspapers lah"

A: I'm not dealing much on the con production side ya
A: Production is a a more intricate thing you got you got to know who are the writers
B: Why they want"
"B: Why they want
A: Ah their intent intention all this so
A: Edmund is dealing with the production side because he's dealing more towards the the the production of comics
A: Uh so but he has a so-called access to the interviews written by others on the with respect to the authors lah the the comic writers lah
A: So maybe he can use that as a as a basis of uhm ya the production side so I don't have access because nobody has interviewed any of the journalists and
B: Why don't you try and interview them
B: I mean wouldn't that be easily maybe you can"
"B: Not correct
A: ah contrary to your research findings it's much easier for you to so-called you know highlight the thing but on the other hand ya if you don't have the research findings in place before prior to the interview then it's quite difficult
B: What else *Interruption* </I>
A: I'm quite interested about the P S C lah especially on the education service but uh my main thrust is to ask them what is because uhm lately there has been calls for increasing teachers' pay so but the details has has not been made known to public so maybe I I hope they can ya that's right
A: But I don't think they will tell me everything lah in details but what I suppose is that they will not exactly touch on the starting pay but more on the increment yearly increment nah because the Civil Service yearly in increment is very little can say is very little
B: Well for my case I won't be interested of any of these simply because I'm already bonded so uhm there's no room for me to look other career until or unless somebody can bail me out of this trap
A: Ah ha but you have to pay uh"

A: Ah ha but you have to pay uh
B: Ya you got"
"A: It's a six year scholarship
B: Yes it's a six six years bond
B: Well if you were to continue teaching I mean if you intend to teach right so we might in the same line because my scholarship is actually teaching
A: Teaching scholarship lah
B: Yes
A: Do you know the starting starting pay
B: Well I'm not very sure"
"B: Well I'm not very sure
B: I guess it's about two thousand
A: Two thousand odd
B: For guys because of the N S thing lah yes
A: But during the the course at N I E will be about one thousand three right and I mean ya one thousand three hundred
B: Well about it
A: And I've been looking through the past years in terms of this uh grant you know I mean teaching grant or teaching bursary whatever they call it"
"A: Do you think it's enough
B: Well actually uhm maybe not now maybe later when the time comes I guess the problem will be there
B: I really don't because presently you don't need the money so and you I guess you won't feel the difference but unless during that time when you start to be involved in the whole programme and you need the money then you starts to voice out again
B: So normally you just tackle the problem when the problems come lah
A: Do you think uh the education service has done uh done their part in terms of retaining the the talented the best in terms of uh teachers
B: Well if you were to look at my case most of my lect tutors in J Cs they have left
B: Ya in fact they are all quite good simply because other places or rather the private sides are paying them more than what the teaching line are doing so I guess one of the method is the pay"
"A: Camp
B: Ya some some are involve in like you know English camps in video camps
B: What have you
A: So to make the career more ex exciting in a sense lah
B: Ya
A: But what what do you think of
A: Okay so far the the"
"A: To deal with the
B: To to to deal with this
A: Administrative
B: nNt only administrative matters but maybe the E C As you know like you know like maybe for instance to talk about N P C C maybe can get some of those people who are more involve in N P C C to to to become guidence or counsellor rather than rather than to get the locals </X> </I>"
"A: Actually the the only thing that we have uh I mean the don't know lah I mean my school we we we we always thought that the that the headquarters didn't like us

A: There is some kind of conception or misconception or some sort lah
B: Really"
"A: Actually the the only thing that we have uh I mean the don't know lah I mean my school we we we we always thought that the that the headquarters didn't like us
B: Why
A: There is some kind of conception or misconception or some sort lah
B: Really
A: I mean because we we we won a lot of competitions
B: True"
"B: It's just talking to us I mean
A: Making conversation
A: Okay all right
A: Ya so so ya I mean I they they they they thought that that we won a little too many lah so ya but there was well I always thought Red Cross should stand for uh the first aid sign lah
A: So actually when when I don't know I uhm when when my my school did better in foot drill I I did question the the rationale
A: Look you know what I mean
A: This you are you're you're supposed surely ought to be better in first aid"
"A: So I guess you didn't really like much drills and all that
A: No actually uh for foot drill I did quite well
A: Ya I think I did quite well at foot drill
A: I enjoyed uhm ya the formations and all that lah
A: I mean it was like quite fun lah you know but there is a lot of hard work lah and I think that because of because of so much drill actually uhm you know physiologically my legs like grew a lot more than my arms
B: Longer
A: Not not longer but I think the the leg muscles are a lot better develop or my leg muscles are a lot better develop than than muscles elsewhere on my body you see"

"A: Ya so my father said that if you don't do push ups you look like a kangaroo
A: Ya anyway I I actually join the Red Cross because uh I I was hoping to to practice uh to go into medical practice
B: Oh I see
A: Ya so it was like you know look you know there there is some kind of connections so why don't I just use it like a trump card lah so to speak
A: But actually I mean all my involvement with Red Cross uh wasn't I mean I I I don't think the the universities took it very seriously because you say oh well you know my interest
A: Ya I got Red-cross to to prove four years but apparently the the university isn't very interested because I got some other friends who did a lot better at their A levels which Red Cross took book as well and still didn't make it to in medical school so ya I suppose
B: So why did you go into law"
"B: So why did you go into law
A: Uhm
B: How did you go into law then
A: Uh I thought on the strength of my English language competency lah
A: Ya
B: What do you mean by competency
A: No I mean it's like I I think I'm I'm I'm fairly comfortable with the English language so"
"A: No I mean it's like I I think I'm I'm I'm fairly comfortable with the English language so
B: Written and oral
A: Written and oral written oral so uh well I mean if if if if if I am really lousy at the Sciences you know why don't I at least use some asset that I have which is competency in English so you know use it in in in in a field of study which which requires that kind of command
A: Uh uh I mean I I won't consider myself proficient lah because there are a lot of words which I still don't use don't know how to use don't know the meaning of so uh ya
B: What's your opinion now of this Singlish
B: Do you think that we should talk the way the other Singaporeans are talking or should we talk the way we have been uh taught and brought up to to to speak like a normal you know rofessional at work
A: Well I think it depends on the uh situation in which you use your language"
"B: Like in my previous job I I still do get the opportunity to do so because of the Chinese-speaking uh population uh the manufacturers
A: You will deal with them uh
B: I deal with them I have to talk with them in their lingo although it is American Multinational
B: Uhm but now now that in the teaching profession very difficult unless I am teaching a Chinese class but I think that is uh a bit too difficult lah
A: Ya correct
B: In terms of our language ability to really teach the subject in Mandarin so to speak probably takes a while to really get a hang of it
A: Ya I know I got some"
"B: And they are supposed to be writing in their English medium uh in exams or whatever projects and <unclear> word </unclear>
A: You know but in a sense I do sympathise with them because they say look you know what I mean
A: It's it's not that we want to how should I say it's it's to aid them in their understanding of the concept
A: Expression of course is another way lah but what is the concept they have this problem you see so I mean ya I I do agree lah that sometimes I wish I could use Chinese or you know but a lot of reservations
B: Ya in case we say the wrong thing
A: Ya I suppose it is like I don't want to be laughed at
B: I mean we want to show the best side of what we are"

A: President
B: Because they always portray the government officials as bureacratics or just just for their own gains and for their own selfish uh own"
"A: Yes
B: Oh must top up meh
B: But I was thinking you put one thousand over dollars into the C P F just to put put it there I think it's quite silly right

"B: Okay I think uh I think maybe what do you think

A: Okay you usually they buy
B: Or maybe have you ever felt that that the great sensation when you walked into the shop and you just pick something up without having to make sure you run through the whole town and look for the cheapest deal
A: So far I have I do not have that courage to do yet"
"A: And motivating the the people who are listening to her and and uhm which is going against what she was preaching because she was actually supposed to

A: So that's what the comments were lah
A: So what what did your lecturer say
B: In in fact uhm she didn't comment on the video
A: Then she went on straight on"
"A: There was an activity
B: There there there was
A: No no lecture
B: Uhm we we have the activity lah yah because we have to so much time anyway only about half an hour
A: You know why because our lecturer was saying that uhm he said most of the time uh the local Singaporean uh students they are always uh remember she said in one of her lecture she said they are impress by those those lect those lecturers who uh who can entertain them
B: Entertain
A: And over and above you know the the content of his lectures so she says this is this one of the reasons uh why because uh she said you you can rest assured that this is one of the uh this these these are the kind of lectures that you can expect if you go overseas uh lectures and they do not take so much you know not like Singapore lecturers"
"A: Yah exactly
A: I I mean there's that's way I I felt that the person who brought this issue out was rather childish
A: I would say to think to I mean to think that we need to be entertained in order to have uh lecture properly conducted that sort of thing because I felt that the content was what matters and it was really uhm uhm something that you know is she made use of materials that were easily obtainable daily life and newspapers and all that and I don't think you need to really entertain
A: Of course that will help but I think what what it boils to is uh yourself lah because we're talking about high-level students here
A: We're not talking about uhm lower level students uh I mean
B: We're suppose to be high-level thinkers yah
A: Yah they should think beyond just entertainment value and all that because I thought that that I was actually rather disappointed that they stopped the film halfway because I was just you know she was just getting into the uhm crucial part of it which is uhm you know ideas for activities"
"A: Oh yah I think so too
B: Well anyway
A: Probably they will would have spared us all the lessons you know always of uh trying to find out what they're uh saying
B: Yah anyhow but I'm enjoying this course so far lah

A: Yah I'm enjoying myself but then

A: Just more time uh"
"B: Oh so between then and now I mean you you need at least to drive a couple of times a month

B: Ya ya I see"
"B: Oh you mean this one you go the one you go to is actually ran by the government
