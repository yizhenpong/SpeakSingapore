A: You are not supposed to tell me
A: Ya it will be kind to me
A: I got to see it eventually [lah]
B: You have to see it <unclear> word </unclear>
A: Ya the thing is that I don't which theatres though
A: It's kind of obscure places"
58,"B: You have to see it <unclear> word </unclear>
A: Ya the thing is that I don't which theatres though
A: It's kind of obscure places
B: No [lah]
B: There are all sorts of interesting twists to it
A: Uhm
B: You know it is like it is very British <unclear> word </unclear>"
59,"B: It is a British film
A: Oh Ai yoh my friend went to see it and she said it was very good also
A: They have you know you said it was very good so
B: Uh [ah]
A: Ya must go see it lah
B: I figured that we get movies like after two months uh after America has it
A: Ya"
60,"A: Oh Ai yoh my friend went to see it and she said it was very good also
A: They have you know you said it was very good so
B: Uh ah
A: Ya must go see it [lah]
B: I figured that we get movies like after two months uh after America has it
A: Ya
B: Uhm"
61,"A: Well it is better than those days when you used to get them about one year or two years later
B: Really
A: Remember those days it was like we get it so late
B: Ah right
A: Six seven about a year later we get the film
B: Oh
A: Ya but now it is almost quite quite close"
62,"B: Oh
A: Ya but now it is almost quite quite close
B: <unclear> word </unclear> Little Mermaid Little Mermaid
A: Uh hah
B: We have it in just after because when I saw it in the States I mean then I came back my goodness after several months they showed it
B: I thought this is dingish <unclear> word </unclear>
B: In the States they already have it on video tapes"
63,"A: For example uh the cha kway teow you go to the cha kway teow man you said one fifty he'll know it's uhm one fifty worth of cha kway teow but if you were to go out and say one fifty to any passerby uhm something will happen
D: I mean besides besides that uhm local and geographical variations uhm for words like uhm gas and petrol uhm is American but petrol is more towards Singapore so uhm if you use the word gas in Singapore people might think that if you wanna buy you wanna you know order a tank of gas for your kitchen stove or something
D: So different ideas behind the words and uhm like Gail was saying for the word home different people have different ideas or different values attached to it right
C: Because they experience uhm it differently I mean in the sense that for some people home would be uhm very good uh very happy comfortable sort of idea whereas to some other people it might mean uhm like uh a broken home where beatings and drunken well whatever [ah] you know that kind of thing ya so it depends on experiences also
B: Say opposition what what you want to say to their points so far
E: Uhm I think what Gail says contradicts what Shirley says because Gail says that uhm in the definition of code you exclude world but then according to Shirley uhm context would therefore include world so I think that's contradiction there and uhm
C: Ya but we are sup we are proposing this motion right which should that we are we define the motion as being a correspondents between form and meaning and we are saying that world is important also so that's why context's important"
64,"B: By all means
E: Okay uhm *laughter*
E: If we were to take necessary condition as p and sufficient condition as q so uhm we do it this way
E: So if p is necessary condition [ah] p is sufficient condition and q is necessary condition neither necessary nor sufficient will be not bracket p or q so this case is true only when both p and q is false
E: So uhm if you want to say that this statement is true you have to prove to us that it is not necessary as well as not sufficient
E: But what we are trying to say that is that we are we we we can prove either of this three cases
E: See we can prove that it is just necessary or you can prove that it is just sufficient or you can prove that it is both necessary and and and sufficient and ours case stands here okay"
65,"F: It all comes under the heading of language you see and as a result it comes under the heading of codes
F: That's how our definition comes about
B: Okay now if I may interject uh for a while I think this this debate is kind of a digressing a little bit from what you're supposed to be talking about
B: Ah this thing about the the code you talk about whether it includes the world or doesn't include the world
B: It's quite a <unclear> word </unclear> point really it's not a point worth debating because you're given this you know in your two zero three you're given this form meaning well thing right and your your well from your reading okay you read it you read that shared code is a system a system of signs right system of signs and what is a sign
B: A sign is a okay a sign is something which ties form and meaning right which is a you know the the classic Sausurrean definition of a sign where you
B: Now when the the word sign is used by the structural linguists you know from Sausure's time the way they use meaning there is not the same as this framework which you've been given two zero three this form meaning world this FMW thing"
66,"B: Now when the the word sign is used by the structural linguists you know from Sausure's time the way they use meaning there is not the same as this framework which you've been given two zero three this form meaning world this FMW thing
B: In fact this FMW thing okay this is just an incidental point which I'm just saying to you now
B: It's it's just an abstraction alright just a framework uh which Dr Ferris is using himself okay which I personally I don't believe in okay
B: The kind of semantics that I do [ah] [ah] this to me this is this is bullshit okay but for your purposes for exam purposes you know if you *laughter*
B: alright
B: So when we talk about meaning in terms of uh the linguistic sign or whatever sign uhm it does not necessarily refer to just this this M alone okay could refer to to your W as well
B: Because when we talk about meaning okay in the Sausurean sense it can be sense as well as reference alright"
67,"B: One letter can represent more than one sound ya
A: Okay for example
B: Like uhm uhm uhm car and uh treat and uh hit
C: Hate hat all using [ah]
A: The ah okay
C: <unclear> word </unclear>
A: Ser Suan any examples"
68,"A: Okay for example
B: Like uhm uhm uhm car and uh treat and uh hit
C: Hate hat all using ah
A: The [ah] okay
C: <unclear> word </unclear>
A: Ser Suan any examples
D: <unclear> word </unclear> Country aspect"
69,"A: Boon Leng
C: Uh I think in the past they they always think that language has everything to do with writing so they always consider that writing is a I mean a a bit I think they're trying to reverse the <unclear> word </unclear> slowly
C: I think it's an over-correction now
A: Ah what does what does over-correction mean
C: That means to say uh they they do correct these false notion to a to a very extreme degree
A: Okay so instead of saying that now we should raise the standard of ah speech to the standard of writing make them equal they actually make it even more important
A: So now they're saying the other way uh the other thing that writing should represent speech"
70,"C: I think it's an over-correction now
A: Ah what does what does over-correction mean
C: That means to say uh they they do correct these false notion to a to a very extreme degree
A: Okay so instead of saying that now we should raise the standard of [ah] speech to the standard of writing make them equal they actually make it even more important
A: So now they're saying the other way uh the other thing that writing should represent speech
C: Ya
A: Okay what other explanations so you have besides over-correction"
71,"A: So now they're saying the other way uh the other thing that writing should represent speech
C: Ya
A: Okay what other explanations so you have besides over-correction
C: Uh they also because in the last in the past when they uh when they were learning how to read and write they they were using uhm I mean the students actually have to pronounce the word so for them uhm the words I mean [ah] they equate them with uh <unclear> word </unclear>
C: So uh but because the the kind of education uh system that we have nowadays is that we just look at the word and the word forms a mental impression on our heads so because the system is different I should think that uhm whoever is uh formulating this assumption must have got it from his ah learning experiences
A: Uhm uhm okay so the old habits of reading and writing affected their view of what spelling should be
A: Then one more thing about maybe they saw a very close connection between writing and speech and therefore they assume that it must be exactly the same"
72,"C: Ya
A: Okay what other explanations so you have besides over-correction
C: Uh they also because in the last in the past when they uh when they were learning how to read and write they they were using uhm I mean the students actually have to pronounce the word so for them uhm the words I mean ah they equate them with uh <unclear> word </unclear>
C: So uh but because the the kind of education uh system that we have nowadays is that we just look at the word and the word forms a mental impression on our heads so because the system is different I should think that uhm whoever is uh formulating this assumption must have got it from his [ah] learning experiences
A: Uhm uhm okay so the old habits of reading and writing affected their view of what spelling should be
A: Then one more thing about maybe they saw a very close connection between writing and speech and therefore they assume that it must be exactly the same
A: What sort of close connection do they see between writing and speech"
73,"A: So if we think that such views are wrong how do you think you can express the relationship better the relationship between speech and writing
E: Under true functions
A: Sorry
E: They've close connection but [ah] they have speech and writing as different functions and they occur in different contact
A: Right so can you give examples of that different functions etcetra
E: Uh speech has uhm paralinguistic function but uh writing doesn't have
A: For example"
74,"A: For example
A: What do you mean
A: Paralinguistic features
E: Uhm their gestures their facial expressions [ah] but you cannot uhm put that into writing
A: Okay that's one
A: What else
A: Choon Kiat"
75,"A: Once you borrow you do you spell it your own way or do you spell it their way
D: They anglicise it
D: It's not the the their own way modified their spelling
A: Ah Latin words
A: Okay what about French words like beauty cigarette
A: When you see the 'ette' you know immediately it's not English it's French right do you *laughs*
A: Intuitively maybe hopefully anyway so what about that"
76,"A: Okay so there are different explanations for etymological spellings
A: What about phonological
A: How did that start
F: Uhm are you referring to [ah] older words which were words which were spelt in a way which was pronounced in the past like for example I think psychology was the p-s was was pronounced in the past right
F: Was it
A: Was it
F: Was it somebody words"
77,"F: Was it somebody words
F: *laughs*
A: What's the point then if that is the case
F: I believe it's not to confuse people right like you [ah] it's been around for so long
A: Oh so you don't eliminate the p
B: But what I thought about phonological is like to reflect an image of sound
A: Ya"
78,"A: I know it's a very new matrix that uh forcing on you all but I hope that after this tutorial you'll be able to see that the s matrix is but one out of many matrices that you can use okay
A: And even if you start out with your s matrix and let's say you need to transform it to another matrix there is no problem
A: Let's say for question uh three or question four rather for question four you find that the t matrix actually is more suitable for practical application
A: There's no problem as a conversion formula between the two so you can always switch from one to the other okay
A: Right so come in come in
A: Right first of all we try to establish the relationship between the s and the t and that's our question three
A: Okay now this is your two port network"
79,"A: Each cycle you shift one bit right
A: Okay now think of how the state of the pipeline will proceed from here
A: Right we've started one job without this okay so we loaded this collision vector one clock cycle later we shifted a one out we cannot start a new job
A: Second clock cycle after that you're shifting a zero you know you can start a new job fine and go ahead and start a new job alright
A: If you do that then the new job is going to fit in it's going to start right here right
A: Two cycles later and the usage pattern will follow the same as the first one so it will go this way this way
A: That's the second job"
80,"A: Can you see
A: Is it too light is it
A: Can you see from behind
A: You can't [ah]
A: Would it help if I turn off the light right
B: Right
A: So we have first of all the nitration of furan the nitration of furan uhm nitration is carried out using what is this reagent uhm Ee Lee"
81,"B: Right
A: So we have first of all the nitration of furan the nitration of furan uhm nitration is carried out using what is this reagent uhm Ee Lee
A: It's the usual nitrating reagent for the hetrocyclic compound Chek Yu
A: Ahum Tin Wee
A: This is the
C: Nitronium acetate
A: Nitronium acetate acetile nitrate alright quite close alright"
82,"A: But for the rest you find that if this is S alright or if it is N-H alright thiophen or pyrrole actually these two alternatives also exist that means it can go like that or by this way
A: But you find that this pathway hardly takes place at all because the activation energy for loss of proton is very small and why is it small
A: It's because aromatic character is well developed in the final product alright so it never even looks at this pathway it is directed along this direction in this direction
A: So because of this [ah] for furan you do not have a straightforward substitution alright of H like N-O-2 but there is an addition by the acetate and ion to give rise to the two five adduct alright which is not stable so you do get back the product that uh one sets out to obtain the two nitrofuran by treatment of heat alright or uh by heat treatment or treatment with pyridine alright that will eliminate the acetate and give rise to the product okay
A: Right so that's for the nitration of furan
A: Now there could be other reagents used in place of acetyl nitrate uh reagents which contain a nitronium cat-ion and which are also weakly acidic
A: One example is nitronium etrafluoroborate this alright nitronium tetrafluoroborate"
83,"A:  In uh in other words asking the court to say look I've got interests this guy can move in but surely he's got to think about me
A:  Could you ask him to give me some money at least you know that sort of thing
A:  So an application for relief Section eighteen CLPA
A:  Okay so now question three the same sets of facts but uhm two a which say that as far as that is concerned uhm the PLA has got uh provision for entry possession
A:  The difference between LPA entry and CLPA entry is that under the LPA the mortgagee has got to give notice the one month notice before he moves in and his notice is given only if there is default
A:  Okay if you remember under Common Law the mortgagee's right to enter is at any time even before the ink is dry on the deed
A:  But in this case in the LTA your entry must be upon default"
84,"A:  You're going to lose your place in the queue and there's no point saying I've got a legal mortgage it is valid therefore I have a power of sale but you're number ten
A:  By the time you come to exercise the power of sale there's nothing to sell right
A:  So you want to be first in line you register
B:  <unclear> word </unclear> being a legal mortgage [ah] doesn't it rank you ahead of the rest already
A:  Yes no because if you don't register you don't have priorities so the fact that you are legal mortgage doesn't matter now because the RODA changes your rights of priority section four basically and section fourteen of the RODA okay
A:  Section section four says you must register section fourteen says once you register you are preserving your priority
A:  Consequently if you don't register you don't preserve your priority"
85,"A:  That's two e and therefore two f is basically the same answer
A:  The unregistered mortgage it doesn't matter whether you are legal or equitable in this case once you're unregistered you do not have priority
A:  Of course the registered legal mortgage will take priority
A:  One small little refinement to this point if the unregistered mortgage is an equitable mortgage you can't you can't register it at all under LTA and since you can't register it there is no fight because here we've got a interest that is unregisterable versus an interest which is registerable and between these two then the the [ah] equitable mortgagee must lodge a caveat to preserve his priority
A:  If he doesn't lodge a caveat I would think he remains outside the register and therefore he has no right at all
A:  Now in this case you would want to note the difference between the RODA system and the LTA
A:  Remember I said that under the RODA whether you are equitable or you're legal you are both registerable"
86,"A:  In the LTA system only legal mortgages can be registered and the equitable mortgage if you want to preserve your prio priority you have to caveat your interest okay
A:  And that sums up everything you need to know about LTA
A:  Questions
B:  Sir when you lodge a caveat right does he rank uh ahead of the legal mortgage <X>
A:  Well the caveat is a sort of notice to the world
A:  Re remember if you remember your fixed charge lectures your first charge is a floating charge
A:  A second charge comes along and it's a fixed charge Now the fixed charge prevails over the floating charge you jump the queue if you're a fixed charge but if you are a fixed charge with notice of a negative pledge cross up here then you take with notice and therefore you take subject to that floating charge interest right Same thing here you've got an equitable mortgage caveated notice to all subsequent people that I've got an equitable mortgage then a legal legal mortgage comes along it's registered but it's registered subject to that interest because there is notice either actual or constructive okay Right Further questions Okay no further questions we move on to our letters of credit and firts question you are now employed by this bank very progressive bank It wants to entertain the customers' wish If you can solve the problems that the requests ah raise So now we want to discuss these problems and see whether it can accede to the customers' requests Okay so Mr Big your customer first request electronic communication facilities for credit Can you accede to that request Would you Are there any problems Mr Big just wants communication facilites to apply for credits to notify his beneficiary to notify himself that his credit has been opened basically that Can you do it Yes No Yes or no S2: Yes"
87,"B:  Sir when you lodge a caveat right does he rank uh ahead of the legal mortgage <X>

A:  Yes Who says no Anyone thinks you won't request uh you won't accede to the request So you think yes All of you think yes Are there no problems then What problems do you think there might be in this case Any problem Okay the technical problems we're not going to discuss them here but anyway this is not a problem because technology exists to allow the customer to communicate with this bank by electronic communications right So it exists The modem is quite cheap the telephone is quite cheap your fax machine all these things are on fact quite common So it's not the question of technology Is there a legal problem Is there a legal problem here What sort what sort of problem do you have here if you think there is a problem Anyone </X> </I>"
88,"A: Now K-L is the mass transfer coefficient in the liquid phase
A: Now sometime we use the word film on top of it partly to identify that this relates to a special phase itself to phase one to phase two so usually we says film mass transfer coefficient
A: Later on you know why we have to use the word film to differentiate from what we call the overall mass transfer coefficient <X>
A: Now this is no different from your heat transfer lecture given by Dr Neo right We have our individual film transfer coefficient and later on we have our overall film transfer coefficent Now this diagram here illustrate the equilibrium relationship between the two phases relating to this particular solute A and this eq the equilibrium curve this arbitrary it can be described by a given equilibrium relationship If it is described by Henry's Law then that is not a <unclear> word </unclear> relationship it is a linear relationship okay Now here we can see that at the interface the composition is represented on the equilibrium curve and if you look at this the slope of this line joining the P-A-G and C-A-L that particular point in other word it describe the bulk concentration to the interface composition That slope is given by minus K-L over K-G It's a ratio of the two mass transfer coefficient Now this are not dimensionless [ah] The slope is not dimensionless because K-L and K-G has different dimension depending on how you what is the concentration uh composition you are using Here we are using partial pressure and molar concentration Now if you change both of this relationship to molar composition then it is dimensionless otherwise it is not okay </X> </I>"
89,"A: I can't see that
B: Where
A: Okay so you had more time to prepare
C: Yah
A: What do you think are the what do you were are the problems with section five which have either been solved or not solved
A: Can we just go through a list of them David
D: I think there's still the difficulty of <unclear> word </unclear> that issue if you"
90,"A: Okay you you say it hasn't solved the framing of the issue of question why
A: *cough*
D: Because there's there's been no direction made out as to uhm how you *telephone rings* how you frame the issue
A: Hello yah hi Debbie nope no why on what how about yourself not coming uh not coming is it
A: That's what announcement do you want
A: Okay I'll ask her you don't want them is it
A: Michael is doing a lecture"
91,"D: Uhm
A: Are you still reading that one
B: No I just I need the three act the acting one
A: Uhm you should read the other one [lah]
B: Uhm
A: Which I'm sure your have read
B: Uhm"
92,"A: Well the problem only exists under Lon and Dalton's approach
A: If you look at <unclear> word </unclear> 's way of framing or frame the issue of question then the problem won't exist
A: Anything
A: And and how would you do it yah
C: For acting's approach got to oh you know what <unclear> word </unclear> all is
A: Ah okay that that could be a problem or okay that that see that's a problem which will not exist for uh would never have existed under <unclear> word </unclear> 's approach
A: But now exists under Atkins' approach"
93,"A: Anything
A: And and how would you do it yah
C: For acting's approach got to oh you know what <unclear> word </unclear> all is
A: Ah okay that that could be a problem or okay that that see that's a problem which will not exist for uh would never have existed under <unclear> word </unclear> 's approach
A: But now exists under Atkins' approach
A: And the problem is even if you were to say that okay that that's the first first difficulty right framing of issue of question
A: Let's go on to the next one"
94,"A: That has not been settled
A: Of course unless the legislative said we leave it to the cases to decide I mean basically it's the Common Law that <unclear> word </unclear> that gives us law
A: Not really satisfactory but but you know there's been an entire range of dicta right
A: Some cases say well mercantile law's not the same as law merchant then you've got <unclear> word </unclear> <unclear> word </unclear> <unclear> word </unclear> and the and the earlier ones I mean <unclear> word </unclear> the whole range of definitions from mercantile law plus you see under Lord Dalton's approach this would not have been a problem at all because the law there would have meant English law
A: Okay but if you take the words with respect to those matters as having qualified the law with strictly to with strictly to mercantile law then again the definition of mercantile law becomes important you see which again is non-settlement yah but the law any problem Siew Hwa
A: The law with respect to those matters
A: Was it necessary"
95,"A: Of course unless the legislative said we leave it to the cases to decide I mean basically it's the Common Law that <unclear> word </unclear> that gives us law

A: The law with respect to those matters
A: Was it necessary
A: Any anything it solves"
96,"D: Well it seems that I think the amendments is trying to qualify that the law the law can be applied in Singapore
A: Okay so again you have two diff conflicting approaches under
A: You have to explain the problem
A: Lord Dalton's approach the whole law of English the whole of English sort of come in Atkins' approach only mercantile law does come in
A: So you've got two different approaches
A: Now again has that been settled by the <unclear> word </unclear> amendment
A: So divided the words with respect to this matter"
97,"A: Do you think that the two approaches are in conflict with one another
D: Yes
A: Do you think the approaches are conflicting enough
A: Think carefully I mean if you say that they are conflicting approaches fine uhm bear in mind except Lord Atkins says he does not disagree with Lord Dalton
A: Do you think they are conflicting approaches
A: You may argue they are conflicting in the sense that they lead to totally different results or someone may argue that well they're not really conflicting they are the same
A: It's just that the starting point of the entire thing is different which actually lead to different results but the approaches are itself not conflicting"
98,"A: The starting point actually <unclear> word </unclear>
A: You will say that that could mean that the approach is the same or one could equally argue <unclear> word </unclear> they're completely different
B: Oh
A: Right 'cos it leads to completely different results as in entire different way because that is not the way Lord Dalton will frame the issue of question law you know Lord Atkins frames it in a very different way I mean you can come to completely different results but you you don't have to sort of take what the book says is correct all the time
A: Okay okay uhm the law with respect to those matters
A: What used to come in and <unclear> word </unclear> the amendments up
A: David you said"
99,"A: Okay okay uhm the law with respect to those matters
A: What used to come in and <unclear> word </unclear> the amendments up
A: David you said
D: Yah I think uhm the amendment was trying was trying to qualify the law applicable in Singapore because he added in 'with respect to those matters' so I would think they would be trying to qualify uh the law to maybe laws relating to banking principles and etcetera
A: Or you can say you think that there was a <unclear> word </unclear> and that this makes it clear that not all law comes in but only mercantile law comes in
D: Yah
A: At this stage I mean you can compare this with the object and purpose of section five and and again you got a whole string of <unclear> word </unclear> law"
100,"A: David you said
D: Yah I think uhm the amendment was trying was trying to qualify the law applicable in Singapore because he added in 'with respect to those matters' so I would think they would be trying to qualify uh the law to maybe laws relating to banking principles and etcetera

D: Yah
A: At this stage I mean you can compare this with the object and purpose of section five and and again you got a whole string of <unclear> word </unclear> law
A: You think the amendment makes it more consistent with our object and purpose of section five
B: It it qualifies the law to be applied to that restricted to mercantile law only"
101,"A: You think the amendment makes it more consistent with our object and purpose of section five
B: It it qualifies the law to be applied to that restricted to mercantile law only
A: Okay fine
A: Any other problem on this section [ah] in in the old uh in the amend pre-amendment cases
A: Don't don't look at the <unclear> word </unclear> okay
A: Look at the cases first
A: Ask yourself okay what were all the problems that exist"
102,"A: The High Court <unclear> word </unclear> will shakes up
A: Can't be that difficult to find
B: <unclear> word </unclear>
A: Yah okay read read the last paragraph
B: Okay uhm I'll like the defence of the real act
B: hese acts in question have no white imperial concern or <unclear> word </unclear>
B: They are very special municipal ways of legislating the region creating creating procedure and machinery and setting up restrictions and sanctions which are quite impossible to Christian ideas"
103,"B: They are very special municipal ways of legislating the region creating creating procedure and machinery and setting up restrictions and sanctions which are quite impossible to Christian ideas
A: Okay let's let's just stop there
A: Do you think that they're very special municipal ways of provision creating procedure and machinery setting up restrictions and sections penalty uh
A: Ah impossible application okay
A: Now ask yourself carefully is this is he talking generally about ah acts suitable or not suitable or is he saying that if an act creates for procedure and machinery and sets up restrictions and sanctions restrictions can be probably licensing and sanctions will be penalty
A: Are his remarks directed at a general applicability test or he's talking about a specific <unclear> word </unclear>
B: Moneylender's Act"
104,"A: Okay let's let's just stop there

A: Are his remarks directed at a general applicability test or he's talking about a specific <unclear> word </unclear>
B: Moneylender's Act
A: No not so much moneylender's act"
105,"A: Is he talking about an act which creates restrictions sanctions procedure and machinery
A: Is he talking about that <X>
A: Do you know what I mean
A: It's interesting because you you take you see okay then you go to look at Lord Atkin Lord okay because he to create this exception uhm <unclear> word </unclear> relied on the word perfect law and its application correct and and that has been discredited so that is all
A: Now Lord Atkin does the same thing Right Lord Atkin says the same thing He says oh you know there's an implied exception correct not found there but but hid it's an implied <unclear> word </unclear> and this the thing that Soon and Pang criticise Right they they say that oh section five it's not possible for section five to have this implied exception not found within the words of the section itself They criticise that part okay So the next question we went on to uh the section five three a allow for this suitability test and to that the answer was no because five three a says modify and adapt whatever has already come in but the suitability test applies at the stage where it determines whether not something comes in so that can't be the one so that that they've argued it as a problem right And think about it carefully If what um <unclear> word </unclear> activity did what Lord Atkin wa talking about in fact Atkin's remark was somewhat similar to her I'm not a general suitability test but they're only talking about acts which create licensing you know concerned with licensing penalties registration Is that exception provided in <unclear> word </unclear> </X>

A: Our last lecture on vicarious liability
A: So let's continue there
A: Now last week yah I was starting to go through some of the rules by <unclear> word </unclear> when an act of an employee is done within the force of employment
A: As I said the phrase force of employment is used rather likely used in the phrase
A: You take care and a lot of things <unclear> word </unclear> yah

A: As far as I carry the liability of return this phrase indicates when policy would tend to make an employer liable to the act of an employee right
A: So first we have to define what the employee's duties are that's logically first step in the analysis
A: The next thing is to try to find the connection between what the employee has done and tort to his people complain of and the employer because at the end of the day we want to make the employer liable right"
110,"A: A case which should be familiar to you right now from our lectures on Richard on sat Richard statutory duty ICI Chapel right
A: You remember in that case <unclear> word </unclear> was supposed to follow certain procedures
A: They were supposed to follow certain procedures when setting off explosives or sorry when testing connection and things like that
A: They decided not to follow these procedures yah and there was an explosion an injury was sustained
A: Now the injury was not deliberately caused right
A: Nobody actually set out to hurt anybody but there was a deliberate departure on the part of the employees from what they were supposed to do
A: They were supposed to test the connection in a certain way they decided not to do it"
111,"A: It's very difficult for the employer to escape vicarious liability for a pure careless act occurring as a result of the employee performing his duties properly if carelessly
A: But in this intermediate position it is slightly easier for the employer to escape vicarious liability
A: Examples of where the another example of where the employer escapes vicarious liability would be for instance the case of Storey and Ashton right
A: This is the case that would be in most of the case books so I'll leave you to look it up yourself except that I'd like you to note that here it involves someone who has finished his duties he had completed his duties in other words and what he did was he took a ride yah he took a ride after that to visit someone
A: It was a personal visit using his employee's carriage
A: While on the way for this personal visit he got into an accident
A: Someone was injured"
112,"A: So was the employer vicariously liable for his carelessness here
A: The answer was no
A: The employee's duties had ended right
A: The court used the phrase that [ah] that employee had gone on a frolic of his own
A: This word <unclear> word </unclear> sample phrases that I'm confident will end up in your vocabulary before very long
A: Just like phrases like floodgates of liability and very often been misused
A: But that really is a phrase which gets used from time to time when we're talking about the employee's duties yah"
113,"A: The court used the phrase that ah that employee had gone on a frolic of his own
A: This word <unclear> word </unclear> sample phrases that I'm confident will end up in your vocabulary before very long
A: Just like phrases like floodgates of liability and very often been misused
A: But that really is a phrase which gets used from time to time when we're talking about the employee's duties yah
A: The stage he has departed from his duties in a manner sufficient to spare the employer liable
A: We often use the phrase the employee went on a frolic of his own
A: That indicates the connection with the employment it's not sufficient to found vicarious liability right"
114,"A: The stage he has departed from his duties in a manner sufficient to spare the employer liable
A: We often use the phrase the employee went on a frolic of his own
A: That indicates the connection with the employment it's not sufficient to found vicarious liability right
A: As I said the test in these kinds of situation would be whether or not tortious conduct the accident while travelling with your friend yah is reasonably incidental to the performance of your duties
A: In Storey and Ashton it's pretty clear that it wasn't reasonably incidental because the employee had finished doing what he was supposed to do
A: He had finished making all deliveries so there was an insufficient connection there
A: But no not all departures from duties will amount to a frolic"
115,"A: The horses ran ran wild caused some injury and the employer was held vicariously liable for those injuries even though he <unclear> word </unclear> from the deliberate departure by the employee from what he was told to do
A: That what I call the intermediate position as I said it lies between deliberate acts and careless acts Careless acts very hard for the employer to escape vicarious liability
A: Deliberate acts more easy for the employer to escape vicarious liability
A: An example of a deliberate tort by the employee yah for which the employer was not held liable would be a local case that went up to the Privy Council Keppel Bus Company and Sa'ad Bin Ahmad
A: This is an this is a case from Singapore I I don't think many of you are old enough to remember there was a Keppel Bus Company but this case really is a stuff which New Paper headlines are made
A: Conductor attacks passenger
A: That's what happened"
116,"A: This is an this is a case from Singapore I I don't think many of you are old enough to remember there was a Keppel Bus Company but this case really is a stuff which New Paper headlines are made
A: Conductor attacks passenger
A: That's what happened
A: The conductor was one of those that fortunately we don't have anymore yah uhm he was he was abusing a passenger
A: The plaintiff like a hero went up and tried to tick the conductor off and got a ticket punched in his eye
A: Now this case is really a very good advertisement for OMO
A: Uhm the plaintiff lost his eye as a result of this assault and he sued the employer right"
117,"A: Now this case is really a very good advertisement for OMO
A: Uhm the plaintiff lost his eye as a result of this assault and he sued the employer right
A: As I said there would have been no point in this case trying to sue the employer
A: This is a mere bus conductor who would have been earning two three hundred dollars a month yah
A: How's he going to make good the loss of the eye
A: Answer he can't
A: So the plaintiff tried suing the employer Keppel Bus Company and what was decided in that case"
118,"A: So the plaintiff tried suing the employer Keppel Bus Company and what was decided in that case
A: Answer the employee's conduct was deliberate wrongdoing by the employee
A: It was deliberate wrongdoing so the employer should not be vicariously liable
A: Now another example of a situation where deliberate conduct spares the employer vicarious liability deliberate tort yah would spare the employer vicarious liability
A: It's a fairly similar case Warren and Henley
A: This time in England
A: A garage station attendant who gets a strange idea in his head and starts accusing a passenger of non-payment sorry uh a customer of not paying his bill"
119,"A: Now again the court said the employer was not liable because this was an assault
A: It was pure vengeance on the part of the employee
A: It's not connected with employment
A: It's deliberate act and therefore the deliberateness of the assault severed the connection with his employment even though he did it during office hours yah even though he did it because he was in that position because he was employed by the by the employer there was still not sufficient con uh connection
A: The deliberateness severed the connection that's necessary to make the employer liable for the tort
A: It would be nice if we could say the uh the employer was never liable for deliberate act but I'm afraid life is not so simple because there are deliberate acts where employers still are liable for the torts right
A: One example is Poland and John Parr"
120,"A: Now when we talk about conduct again I would avoid defining conduct too narrowly
A: We're not talking about whether or not the employer benefited from the blow being struck by the employee in Poland and Paar right
A: We're talking about whether the employee thought he was something for the benefit of the employer in other words guarding the goods right
A: Compare that for instance the Keppel Bus Company and Sa'ad Bin Ahmad and Warren and Henley right <X>
A: Those are situations where the conduct clearly didn't benefit the employer The employee was simply doing it for revenge for his own purposes He wasn't trying to benefit the employer Now in the Privy Council in Keppel Bus and Sa'ad Bin Ahmad the court mentioned for instance that the plaintiff might have recovered from the employee employer The employer might have been vicariously liable if the bus conductor's conduct at that time had been connected with his duties as bus conductor So if for instance the bus conductor had been trying to maintain order on an unruly bus passengers were screaming and shouting He was trying to push people back into the seat right And he committed an assault in the course of trying to do that then that would be related enough to his duties that the employer would have been vicariously liable There is then potentially a connection a connection if a connection can be made between what the employee is doing and the benefit of the employer then the employer may still be vicariously liable even though the tort has been committed deliberately But when you have clear situations like Keppel Bus Company and Sa'ad Bin Ahmad and Warren and Henley when assault by the employee were absolute were purely personal there was no thinking on the part of the employee that I'm doing this for the good of my employer then the employer would escape vicarious liability for the deliberate tort of the employee right Simple enough isn't it </X> </I>"
121,"A: We're not talking about whether or not the employer benefited from the blow being struck by the employee in Poland and Paar right

C: okay [lah] okay [lah] okay [lah]
A: Censored censored </X> </I>"
178,"A: Okay let's get started
A: We're going to talk about uh working with parents today and uh this going to be very important because when you go to the primary schools you'll be working a lot with parents a lot more than when you are in secondary school alright
A: So we're going to look at different aspects of uh parent-teacher relationship and why is it important to establish good relationship with parents okay
A: Do you think you could get settled down and yah
A: Okay so uh to start off we want to talk about the different types of uh school-home relationships
A: Uhm I re I think most of us are from different types of schools uhm perhaps government schools and others the uh the government-aided school
A: So there are actually different types of relationships that these schools have with the family or with parents uh only like to suggest that the very first type of school is what 'keep out' you know"
179,"A: If you want to come that's fine too usual type
A: And then of course there are the P-T-A school parent-teacher association
A: Uhm I think a number of schools in Singapore have taken this kind of approach now but mainly I think the pity is that most of them <unclear> word </unclear> to fund raising
A: You know they are referring to curtains [ah] wanna donate money to build the swimming pool and things like that
A: That's about it alright
A: And of course there are the true community schools where uh surely you read the report about the new Raffles Girls' school where they're going to have uh open up the school premises for computer classes <unclear> word </unclear> in the evening alright where they're going to welcome parents in to uhm conduct courses for the students in there okay that's a community school
A: So when you go to school the next time you're going to see for yourself what what what kind of school do you think your school falls under"
180,"A: And sometimes the parents will ask you in school uh when they talk with the teachers in in the process of talking with the teachers they can learn something about how important the parental role is just a guidance and supervision
A: Not only in academic areas but in the others in social emotional development <unclear> word </unclear> right
A: And of course parents can make some significant significant contributions to the school
A: Ah not sure whether you re have read articles about uh schools like St Nicholas
A: Have you read anything about the art where they actually ask parents to come in to talk on certain programs
A: Is anybody familiar with that kind of uh interaction that St Nicholas school has
A: Do you know what what they do"
181,"A: Is anybody familiar with that kind of uh interaction that St Nicholas school has
A: Do you know what what they do
B: <unclear> word </unclear>
A: Yah they did
B: <unclear> word </unclear>
A: <unclear> word </unclear>
B: Singapore teach uh to teach courses"
182,"A: To teach courses I see
A: Now what sort of courses can you
B: Story-telling
A: Ah okay story-telling
A: Oh parents are involved with reading program
A: They actually break the children into small groups and parents come in to read to the kids or they help out in help help out in library work and things like that okay
A: And I think they do something about gardening too right"
183,"A: I think they've this thing called Meet the Parents and they've lots of concerts where they invite parents right
A: Uh I don't know how many of your parents went to school
A: Okay this some of the ways to establish good relationship with the to make the school as a welcoming place
A: Uh well as <unclear> word </unclear> says inviting school [lah] you know facilitating this inviting environment
A: Are there things around parents can walk in and see that they know that they are welcomed alright
A: They'll talk about I know the oversea they talk about parents' room they even have special bulletin boards for parents you know when they can hold up some information for parents
A: I'm not sure whether this is done in Singapore I don't think any school has a parent room"
184,"A: So I think parents uh can be asked to fork out there
A: Okay so these are some of the ways and some very specific ways would be uh written communication where there are class bulletins there there are newsletters especially for parents got to bring the facts there
A: Now I was in the hospital last time *laughs*
A: Yah okay so there are there are special newsletters for parents involve parents in <unclear> word </unclear> in school and future events and uh some achievements of students there and things like that [lah] okay
A: Uh as far I know <unclear> word </unclear> A-C-S has one Report Express
A: Not sure about other schools
A: Have you come across any"
185,"1: First of all waste stabilisation occurs only in the reactor that is here
1: That means you're saying there is no waste stabilisation occurring in the settling tank
1: Now this of course will be conservative since there will be some degree of waste stabilisation by the micro-organisms in the settling unit as well right
1: But for analysis we make this assumption that any B-O-D [ah] with <unclear> word </unclear> taking place only in this unit Secondly volume use in calculating the mean cell residence time all the system includes only the volume of the reactor unit okay
1: So since this follows up from here right since there's no B-O-D <unclear> word </unclear> in this unit alright you may consider the mean cell residence time you only take into account the volume of your reactor
1: Okay so by definition the mean hydraulic retention time all the reactor that teta will be d over q v will be your volume of your reactor that your fluid b ah b is constant
1: This time if you consider hydraulic retention time for the systemthen for the system b will be reactor volume plus <unclear> word </unclear>tank volume alright"
186,"1: Now this of course will be conservative since there will be some degree of waste stabilisation by the micro-organisms in the settling unit as well right
1: But for analysis we make this assumption that any B-O-D ah with <unclear> word </unclear> taking place only in this unit Secondly volume use in calculating the mean cell residence time all the system includes only the volume of the reactor unit okay
1: So since this follows up from here right since there's no B-O-D <unclear> word </unclear> in this unit alright you may consider the mean cell residence time you only take into account the volume of your reactor
1: Okay so by definition the mean hydraulic retention time all the reactor that teta will be d over q v will be your volume of your reactor that your fluid b [ah] b is constant
1: This time if you consider hydraulic retention time for the systemthen for the system b will be reactor volume plus <unclear> word </unclear>tank volume alright
1: So your mean cell residence time teta c we call that definition teta c will be mass of cells in the reactor over mass of cells wasted per day
1: Mass of cells in the reactor that's v-x in the reactor"
187,"1: The outgrowth this is the amount leaving the reactor the amount leaving the settling unit and that will be your net growth
1: So now we come back to the assumptions we say we usually make
1: Assuming cell concentration and inflow is zero i-e x-y is zero
1: Steady state the x vility is zero then this means this is zero this is zero and simplifies to you just bring over this side you get this expression here equals to v multiplied by r-g prime r-g prime being your next specific uh your net growth your net [ah] bacterial growth rate alright
1: And of course your r-g prime is equals to this expression here without the x term
1: So if you divide by d-x and if you look at this term here and what we define as one over teta c in the previous transparency this actually would be one over teta c alright
1: In the previous transparency this term here the left hand side term is one over teta c"
188,"1: This time this would be the mass of cells that is wasted from your settling unit that will be the amount leaving your settling unit alright
1: So distance here will be changed slightly
1: Again assuming x-e is very small then it simplifies the this expression
1: So to calculate x which is your concentration of your [ah] cells within the reactor
1: It's the same expression as you've seen before same expression except that now teta c takes a different expression alright
1: I have discussed only about x so far
1: What about your substrate concentration or your B-O-D which is s"
189,"A: Lee
A: She's here to tape uhm the lecture for uh research
A: Uhm today is the last lecture for for the history of music course
A: Ah and we'll be covering very briefly uhm compo composers and compositions from the nineteen fifty onwards
A: None of these compositions that I'll be mentioning are on the wide listening list
A: These are additional works which you might have to identify to in the unknown so okay please listen to the features of these composition when you ah are listening now uh
A: Okay by the nineteen fifty now a majority of performers and composers had already familiarised themselves with uhm the twelve tones serial technique of Schoenberg <unclear> word </unclear> and Webern as we were discussing two weeks ago"
190,"A: Uhm today is the last lecture for for the history of music course

A: None of these compositions that I'll be mentioning are on the wide listening list
A: These are additional works which you might have to identify to in the unknown so okay please listen to the features of these composition when you [ah] are listening now uh
A: Okay by the nineteen fifty now a majority of performers and composers had already familiarised themselves with uhm the twelve tones serial technique of Schoenberg <unclear> word </unclear> and Webern as we were discussing two weeks ago
A: Uh not all of them accepted the serialisation techniques of these composers but for those who did such as Babbit B-a-b-b-i-t and Messiaen
A: Those that adopted the twelve tones techniques went further and serialised almost all aspects of music composition"
191,"A: Now these composers favoured more control with con more control over their compositions
A: So they wanted every aspect of their composition serialised and on the other hand there was another group that favoured less control over their composition
A: Now these composers included Cage Cage Boulet B-o-u-l-e-t Stockhausen S-t-o-c-k-h-a-u-s-e-n
A: Of course Stockhausen and Boulet also wrote serial [ah] serial music okay
A: Now there were two opposing camps and one favoured music as thought thought processing huh control and the other as sound
A: Two camps
A: One is thought and one is sound freedom"
192,"A: Another innovation came from John Cage C-a-g-e we spoke of them earlier who wrote very much for the prepared piano prepared piano in the nineteen forty where he had bolts screws spoons forks uh rubber eraser uh inserted in the strings to create a kind of percussion ensemble
A: Now of course you'll give instructions as to uh the pianist will reach for the inner key and play this this string or that string in a particular manner or fashion or to strike a string inside the keyboard rather than on the white key
A: These are new innovational techniques
A: Also uh popular were the new harmonics that were explored at this time
A: Techniques new harmonic and new techniques such as the increased use of flutter tongue technique in wind instrument
A: <unclear> word </unclear> you had chromatic clusters and all the voice the spoken word as well uhm as you can see the voice has to speak certain things indicated huh very syllabic words of vowels sometimes or whispered sounds or halfway between voice and speech question mark
C: Uhm uhm"
193,"A: Occasionally the instrumentalists were uh requested to say these sounds too to participate vocally rather than just playing
A: The percussion ensemble well increased in size as well and there was a a greater need for more exotic instruments that were being used
A: Instruments such as the gamalan uhm the gongs more Asian instruments that were used this time
A: For the sirens when <unclear> word </unclear> siren a fire instrument to be used in the ensemble could actually it's a pity we took the uhm projector from here [lah]
A: Uhm I made this transparency to show you the trends that took place in the nineteen after nineteen hundred okay
A: You can see we have experimental tradition right at the top nineteen twenties and we have mainstream okay
A: Mainstream we have people like Ravel in the mid composing alongside and then under experimental tradition we have composers such as Ives Shoenberg Webern <unclear> word </unclear> huh"
194,"A: Okay uhm thirties with sound mass noise uhm composers such as <unclear> word </unclear> all compose so you see how they uhm the score is done is down
A: It's grey and black lines and sheets of lines and if you wanna crescendo you see uh expansion of this kind of graphics thicker darker lines okay
A: And there's no note uh written down just masses of colour or sound and after the thirties it branched off into less control and more control
A: So under less control we have indeterminacy which is a an important term you'll remember and more control ultra serialisation such as Babbit uhm Babbit Messiaen who serialised all as other aspects of their music such as colour dynamics ahah
A: So on this side we have then we went further to go into computerisation where they use computers to write music uhm
A: On the right hand side you can see we have use of new instruments after nineteen forties <unclear> word </unclear> is one of them just mention him
A: Uhm improvisation techniques like composers uh gave performers a free hand and doing what they want I'll go on further with this and parallel to this we see chance music which uh John Cage is a very important proponent of this kind of music uhm"
195,"A: Uhm improvisation techniques like composers uh gave performers a free hand and doing what they want I'll go on further with this and parallel to this we see chance music which uh John Cage is a very important proponent of this kind of music uhm
A: And further down the line before sixties we see new instrumental technique improvisational groups further on and live electronic music that comes straight down from the experimental tradition and theatre music happenings and anti-art
A: Maybe I'll I'll make a copy of this for you all since you're can't read this okay
A: So you see the tradition of the composers streaming [ah] taking opting for one route or the other but of course during the fifties uh it's a very experimental time and most composers dabbled at one or the other like Stockhausen's works uh Messiaen Babbit too and some of them would also write for non serial or chance music okay
A: Then we go on to Berio which I'll speak on briefly because uh I brought the CD along the songs for Cathy which Berio wrote for his wife Cathy Berberian B-e-r-b-e-r-i-a-n and I'll play the sequenza for you Sequenza Three for voice for his wife which he wrote in fifty six
A: Okay Luciano Berio B-e-r-i-o was born in nineteen twenty five in <unclear> word </unclear> nineteen twenty five <unclear> word </unclear>
A: He's a composer conductor and teacher and explored much theater music"

A: He married uh the American singer Cathy Berberian in nineteen fifty whom he also wrote extensively for voice
A: He wrote nine sequenzas in all for various solo instruments piano the harp the trombone the voice and you see in his compositions the sequenzas uh a tendency to uhm have very theatrical features in it
A: For instance the sequenza five were trombone"
197,"A: Now what we will do today for the first half hour or so is I want to uhm go through the answers alright for the assignment questions that are given to you okay
A: You all settle down please
A: Alright the first assignment question was question five c
A: Okay I think most of you manage to do this question but some of you well I don't know what to say here [ah] but anyway this is the answer right
A: Now in the question five c you were asked whether a precipitate will form when the pH of a point 01 mole per dm cube solution of magnesium chloride is adjusted to ten
A: Now in the previous tutorial I gave you this hint right
A: The hint the key word is supposed to be pH ten"
198,"A: You all settle down please
A: Alright the first assignment question was question five c
A: Okay I think most of you manage to do this question but some of you well I don't know what to say here ah but anyway this is the answer right
A: Now in the question five c you were asked whether a precipitate will form when the pH of a point 01 mole per dm cube solution of magnesium chloride is adjusted to ten
A: Now in the previous tutorial I gave you this hint right
A: The hint the key word is supposed to be pH ten
A: That means your solution is alkaline"
199,"A: That means your solution is alkaline
A: Alkaline meaning that there is an excess of OH minus for hydroxide ion so you have to calculate your concentration of hydroxide ion alright and you do this using your POH value okay
A: So your concentration for hydroxide will be ten to the power minus four mole per dm cube
A: Now why are you interested in this hydroxide ion concentration because there's a possibility that your NG two plus that comes from your magnesium chloride and your hydroxide can come together to form your white solid magnesium hydroxide as a precipitate okay
A: Right so you are not concerned about magnesium chloride your concentration of chloride ions
A: You're more concerned about these two okay
A: So you have a concentration of hydroxide"
200,"A: Alkaline meaning that there is an excess of OH minus for hydroxide ion so you have to calculate your concentration of hydroxide ion alright and you do this using your POH value okay
A: So your concentration for hydroxide will be ten to the power minus four mole per dm cube
A: Now why are you interested in this hydroxide ion concentration because there's a possibility that your NG two plus that comes from your magnesium chloride and your hydroxide can come together to form your white solid magnesium hydroxide as a precipitate okay
A: Right so you are not concerned about magnesium chloride your concentration of chloride ions
A: You're more concerned about these two okay
A: So you have a concentration of hydroxide
A: You have a concentration of <unclear> word </unclear>"
201,"A: Uhm some mistakes are you forgot to raise your OH minus expression to the power of two okay
A: Now anyway your ionic product will be this value which far exceeds your solubility product of magnesium hydroxide
A: Therefore you can compute that uh precipitate <unclear> word </unclear> four okay
A: So for question five c right you cannot say that since magnesium chloride is a soluble salt no precipitate formed
A: You have to bear uhm bear in mind that it is an alkaline solution alright
A: Any questions
A: No"
202,"A: Any questions
A: No
A: Okay question six question six right uhm for this one what you have is a saturated solution of hydrogen sulphide alright
A: Now you are given a specific concentration of metal ion and a specific concentration of hydrochloric acid okay
A: So your metal ion it's concentration equals to one mole per dm cube alright
A: Now your concentration of hydrochloric acid because this is a strong acid it will completely dissociate
A: So this will be equivalent to the amount of H plus that is present in solution which is zero point two five mole per dm cube okay"
203,"A: Okay question six question six right uhm for this one what you have is a saturated solution of hydrogen sulphide alright
A: Now you are given a specific concentration of metal ion and a specific concentration of hydrochloric acid okay
A: So your metal ion it's concentration equals to one mole per dm cube alright
A: Now your concentration of hydrochloric acid because this is a strong acid it will completely dissociate
A: So this will be equivalent to the amount of H plus that is present in solution which is zero point two five mole per dm cube okay
A: Right
A: Now what we have to do then is to calculate the sulphide ion concentration"
204,"A: Now for seven b there was some confusion alright
A: What you want to do is in this system that contains silver plus ion and chromate ion you want to dissolve HCL alright but you want to dissolve the HCL in such a way that you have a saturated solution but no precipitate will form
A: Now what is this precipitate that will form
A: The precipitate will be silver chloride
A: Okay because HCL will dissociate in solution to give you the ions alright
A: So what you have again like I always say it's soup of ion
A: Okay these two will not precipitate out just saturated"
205,"A: Okay because HCL will dissociate in solution to give you the ions alright
A: So what you have again like I always say it's soup of ion
A: Okay these two will not precipitate out just saturated
A: Now what you want to know is how much of this hydrochloric acid can I add such that these two can be present in solution and will not come up as a solid precipitate okay
A: Right
A: So most of you misunderstood the question you thought that oh it's a completely new system I'm using a new solution that contains just silver chloride
A: No"
206,"A: Okay these two will not precipitate out just saturated
A: Now what you want to know is how much of this hydrochloric acid can I add such that these two can be present in solution and will not come up as a solid precipitate okay
A: Right
A: So most of you misunderstood the question you thought that oh it's a completely new system I'm using a new solution that contains just silver chloride
A: No
A: Alright you're using the same solution as in part seven a with a new twist now your bubbly HCL into it alright
A: Okay so how do you calculate this part the maximum amount of HCL that can be added"
207,"A: No
A: Alright you're using the same solution as in part seven a with a new twist now your bubbly HCL into it alright
A: Okay so how do you calculate this part the maximum amount of HCL that can be added
A: First you need to calculate the maximum chloride concentration that can be dissolved alright and the only way you can do this is to equate this with Ksp for a saturated solution of silver chloride
A: Now where did you get this silver plus from Right silver plus from
A: Your original solution containing silver and chromate and ion right
A: Therefore your silver plus concentration is actually your answer to seven a okay"
208,"A: Your original solution containing silver and chromate and ion right
A: Therefore your silver plus concentration is actually your answer to seven a okay
A: Right
A: Most of you equate oh silver plus equals chloride so you just put s and s so it's s square equals to Ksp and you square it your whole expression you get your chloride concentration
A: No
A: Alright
A: That is actually misreading the question okay"
209,"A: No
A: Alright
A: That is actually misreading the question okay
A: So your silver plus concentration you get from part seven a and from this you can calculate your chloride concentration which is a very small value uh
A: Right seven point nine four times ten to the power of minus seven mole over dm cube Can you all see this
A: You all are speaking the answer is it Okay now for the next part alright uhm expressing your chloride in terms of concentration is not enough because the question asks you for the mass you know mass of HCL that can be dissolved in two hundred and fifty cm cube of the solution okay
A: So what you have to do is actually calculate the number of moles HCL that can be dissolved in two hundred and fifty cm cube alright"
210,"A: That is actually misreading the question okay
A: So your silver plus concentration you get from part seven a and from this you can calculate your chloride concentration which is a very small value uh
A: Right seven point nine four times ten to the power of minus seven mole over dm cube Can you all see this
A: You all are speaking the answer is it Okay now for the next part alright uhm expressing your chloride in terms of concentration is not enough because the question asks you for the mass you know mass of HCL that can be dissolved in two hundred and fifty cm cube of the solution okay
A: So what you have to do is actually calculate the number of moles HCL that can be dissolved in two hundred and fifty cm cube alright
A: Now you know that your chloride concentration is equivalent to your hydrochloric acid concentration
A: This is because hydrochloric acid will completely dissociate into ions okay"
211,"A: Right seven point nine four times ten to the power of minus seven mole over dm cube Can you all see this
A: You all are speaking the answer is it Okay now for the next part alright uhm expressing your chloride in terms of concentration is not enough because the question asks you for the mass you know mass of HCL that can be dissolved in two hundred and fifty cm cube of the solution okay
A: So what you have to do is actually calculate the number of moles HCL that can be dissolved in two hundred and fifty cm cube alright
A: Now you know that your chloride concentration is equivalent to your hydrochloric acid concentration
A: This is because hydrochloric acid will completely dissociate into ions okay
A: So therefore your HCL concentration will also be the same value right
A: And from there you use proportion to calculate the maximum mass of HCL in two hundred and fifty cm cube"
212,"A: You all are speaking the answer is it Okay now for the next part alright uhm expressing your chloride in terms of concentration is not enough because the question asks you for the mass you know mass of HCL that can be dissolved in two hundred and fifty cm cube of the solution okay
A: So what you have to do is actually calculate the number of moles HCL that can be dissolved in two hundred and fifty cm cube alright
A: Now you know that your chloride concentration is equivalent to your hydrochloric acid concentration
A: This is because hydrochloric acid will completely dissociate into ions okay
A: So therefore your HCL concentration will also be the same value right
A: And from there you use proportion to calculate the maximum mass of HCL in two hundred and fifty cm cube
A: Right you just divide the answer by four and multiply by the molecular mass of HCL you get a very small value okay"
213,"A: Any of you all have any questions
A: Yes
A: Yes
A: No what you're talking about is [ah] you're confusing number of moles and concentration
A: Now whether I have two hundred and fifty cm cube or or one thousand cm cube solution alright a saturated solution of silver chromate will always have the same concentration of silver ion but the number of moles present in two hundred and fifty cm cube and present in one thousand cm cube will be different okay
A: Alright uhm now if you see in seven a okay what is the mass of AG plus in one dm cube of a saturate solution of silver chromate
A: Alright now that means your answer will be gram for every one dm cube correct"
214,"A: That's also AG plus concentration alright
A: So it's the number of moles in one dm cube
A: Yes yes
A: Ya oh no no no no if you read seven b [ah] what is the maximum mass of hydrogen chloride that can dissolve in two hundred and fifty cm cube of a saturated solution of silver chromate saturated solution of silver chromate and uh for seven b and seven a also saturated solution of silver chromate
A: So in both cases seven a and seven b one is one dm cube the other one is two hundred and fifty cm cube However both are saturated solution and therefore no matter what the volume you have for solution your concentration of silver plus is still is still the same because both solutions are the same it's just that you have different volumes of them <X>
A: However your number of moles of silver plus will be different There'll be more in the one thousand cm cube than in two hundred and fifty cm Concentration is different What No there is no dilution You don't transfer or what you just use the same solution and you just bubble in HCL that's all okay Alright Any other questions None </X> </I>"
215,"1.0: So ancient
1: Ah okay okay
1.0: So we'll finish up the last chapter before we go on
1.0: Anyway they are all related to soil so it's quite okay
1.0: Right I think if I'm not mistaken did I did I finish up this with you"
216,"1.0: Ya okay and then of course most soil will not be able to reach the bed-rock level
1.0: So most of the time we are making use of the top soil
1.0: Right tying your hair now is it
1: Now this one its its experiment uhm we did is this [ah] something like that ya
1.0: Uhm this is to show you which level is occupied by what
1.0: The lower levels would be stones then we have large particles then small particles silt very small particles clay human and living material right
1.0: So the top part okay"
217,"1.0: If you are in the if you are growing in the region or rather if you are a plant you grow in the region where there is only clay it's very bad only sand is very bad
1.0: You will be very lucky if you can find a place where you have good soil and then germinate and grow
1.0: Uhm that is the reason why dispersal of seed is very important
1: If the if if you make use of a very good dispersal mechanism [ah] then you'll land in a good place and you will sprout there okay
1.0: So uhm most of the time plants will produce lots of seed so that just in case you know uhm only a few of them would find a good place to germinate alright and a lot of time also the seeds are able to uhm remain dormant that is they do not germinate at all if they are uh blown to a place whereby the condition is not right
1.0: So they will just stay there dormant and hope that another gust of wind or animal or whatever will bring them to somewhere else to germinate okay
1.0: So soil condition is very very important to plants alright"
218,"1.0: Remember when we did soil we said that uhm soil is obtained when we through weathering of rock and so on
1.0: So this the most or rather im immediate supply will be when rocks become weathered down by uh the different rain sun and all this type okay so you get sedentary soil alluvial soil will be composed of mineral particles which have been carried long distances from their place of origin through valley bottom and coastal plain and usually this is through by this is by what
1.0: How how are these soil transported
1: Ah
1.0: Again water rain natural elements okay natural elements wind and so on okay
1.0: Alright Topsoil and subsoil okay are with the top type of soil
1.0: You have loam soil yesterday we give we we we did not have a chance to do loam soil but we had what uh what soil as you know in garden soil okay that is uh after it has been treated uh okay"
219,"1.0: Clear or not
1.0: I'm nervous you know *laughter*
1.0: Okay
1: Ah let me introduce you to this pretty lady here
1.0: Alright she's a good friend of mine
1.0: Her name is Brenda Koh
1.0: She's doing a some kind of a research on the kind of English I use"
220,"1.0: One two three four five
1.0: Who said there's a current
1.0: You all don't know
1: I put up my hand means have [lah]
1.0: You all never put up your hands alright
1.0: There is a current
1.0: What is the nature of the current"
221,"1.0: What's the resistance of material
1.0: N-type material
1.0: Don't know
1: Don't know [ah]
1.0: Know or not
1.0: Know or not
1.0: Any material right"
222,"1.0: Alright we call this the saturation current for the JFET
1.0: Can or not
1.0: Okay now next thing
1: I'm going to make it more complicated [ah]
1.0: Can I let's say I don't consider this voltage
1.0: Put in a voltage here alright
1.0: Put in available voltage here what happen"
223,"1.0: And then at the point where VGG equals to your pinch down voltagea then it will join together and your ID equals to zero all the time alright then you get a case where you call this the pinch down phase ID equals to zero
1.0: Understand
1.0: Yes
1: Understood understood [ah]
1.0: Yes Mr Eddy
1.0: Do you know what you are asking or not

1.0: Can you all hear or not
1: Louder [lah] come on
1.0: The mike cannot hear hurry up louder
1.0: Okay how come there's a reverse bias to the p and the n
1.0: Let's say I don't have this uh okay"
225,"1.0: Okay once you understand we can go on
1.0: Common-Source
1.0: Forward Transconductance very chim term but actually don't worry about the definition alright
1: It sounds very long doesn't matter all you need to remember is this formula okay
1.0: This guy equals to this
1.0: That's what it means alright
1.0: Ah I told you before engineers define things by equations so here we define Gm as a common-source forward transconductance as change in ID over change in VDS for constant value or for a value of VDS equals to zero that means to shock the you shock the drain source voltage alright"
226,"1.0: It sounds very long doesn't matter all you need to remember is this formula okay

1.0: A couple of weeks ago you had a lecture on the rational problem-solving approach today we are not doing the rational problem-solving approach we are doing the creative problem-solving approach and if you recall in our film on the ABC of decision making the conclusion was that it is actually very good if you can base your decision on number one"
231,"1.0: That is the rational problem-solving approach and we all can reason
1.0: However there's only one mental power and we also need to now come to the fourth mental power called the creative mental power that we have and this is the ability in which we can generate ideas and we need to have more and better ideas

1.0: But after you got all the necessary input and you're able to sense or to recognize the problem from different angles then you come to a more uh subconscious or even unconscious called incubation where you are sleeping over the problem
1: Somebody will say aiyah I think we cannot find the answer today let us sleep over it and think it over you know in our quieter time or something like that and you will find that this is uh where your mind your conscious mind then let your unconscious mind that means a bigger part of your mind think about it and sometimes you may have realized that uh after you had a good sleep you wake up oh you say [ah] I have found the solution oh now I know the solution huh <X>

A: A treatment is supposed to sell your story
A: Now your editor may say okay go ahead with the treatment just for audience
A: Sometimes you may be doing a documentary for overseas consumption your audience is different so you have to bear that in mind too
A: Now in a documentary it's quite different from a news story okay
A: You may be able to figure out okay in this story in this news story this is the kind of angle this is what's new that's why I'm going for this press conference or that's why I'm attending this event"

B: when you're filming when you're filming and there's someone who's with you who knows more about the place you need to talk to that person as you're filming and say this is important ask him why is it important and that's your other research It's while you're doing the the filming you're actually researching in detail Now the other thing is of course this is this is an instance where I couldn't I wasn't sent ahead of the crew to do my racking my research etcetra so I have to do it then and there when we are shooting But what happens when you are in Singapore Is there a reason to do it on as you are going along researching as you uhm film Sometimes yes let's say when you want to do a story on nature you know the birds are supposed to be in a forest On the day you racky the birds are all there in fact I counted ten types ten species within an hour I was so ex excited The day I went without Christopher Hales the guy who the ornithtologist the the day I went with my crew and without him there was no bird to be sighted for One whole morning It's not it's really no joke because uhm they just don't come out on the day I don't know Maybe the guys were smoking so the <unclear> word </unclear> birds can read some smoke signals and I was panicking my will Woon Tye Ho understand you know that we were there but there were no birds especially since I sold him the story by telling him that at least ten species you know Within half an hour can see ten species Okay sold do the story First day of shoot no birds second of sh shoot no birds so what happens So you have to script the unpredictable Whatever you have write in A breakdown script okay </X> </I>"

1: Now please be highly conscious that this is identical to Lear in terms of perceptions
1: You are going to always one of the principles that there is no one view about love that's presented by Shakespeare
1: But you're rather going to have [ah] multiple views presented by the multiple sets of characters

260,"A: Mr Goh Chok Tong has asked for the endorsement for his premiership and he says the PAP will get their endorsement if it improves on its 1988 percentage
A: By how many percentage points
A: Do you think it will have to improve to gain a comfortable margin Bilveer
B: Ya while dangerous to speculate I think after Nomination Day results and in view of the lack of general substantive issues [ah] as I see in this particular election my guess is to get a clear mandate anything between sixty four to sixty eight would be regarded in my view as a clear endorsement
A: Thian Ser do you share the view
C: It's not a bad number to put into a ball park area
C: In part because the Prime Minister has said that he wants more open views"
261,"D: So I think this campaign hangs on his personality and whether the changes have taken place because we have seen accommodation of uh some of the ? opposition type views into the PAP's style of government now
D: At one time it was the the general consensus was that the government is very confident of itself it states its case that's it
D: But now we're getting a position where the PAP is sort of saying well we have a position but we're willing to listen to the public we're listen to to to to the voters
D: That's happen in say the [ah] car policy that's now happening in the area of health cost
D: So I think Mr Goh says to be judged on his personality and approach it it would be appear to be an important issue here
D: I would agree with clear with things here that the real question is actually political legitimacy
D: I think there is a feeling that he has been given the premiership without the mandate of the people and now he think the timing is right"
262,"C: I think the the worries over the economy probably there's some pros in it I mean what's happened in Russia is very major
A: Is the government concerned about the possible economic downturn
A: I'm not sure they hasn't said that openly but uh many people in the business sector are concerned of possible fears because cost are still rising in the economy and that's a problem
D: And I think in addition to that [ah] in this country I think what hits the pocket is politically significant and I think there is a perception I mean it may be wrong but at least there's a perception even in the public mind that the economy is taking slowly but surely a flight
D: And politically if you don't hit now and you hit later whether in 92 or 93 I think it can be costly
D: So it's from that perspective that I think the timing factor and its relationship with economic cannot be dismissed
A: If we can come back to Mr Goh pushing himself as the issue in this election uh is there a risk for him in doing this Peter"
263,"C: I think people will go out to vote if not for anything at least for Mr Goh
C: I've heard people saying I like Mr Goh I don't like the MP I don't know what to do but I'd rather vote with Mr Goh than take a gamble you know
A: Peter do you think in announcing a by-election in twelve to eighteen months Mr Goh has in fact undercut the strategy of the opposition <X>
A: I don't think so because uh you know the uh the uh the the bas the basic strength of the SDP's tactic in saying look let's fight this by-election is still there you know whether whether it's by-election now or by-election one and a half years from now so it's a it's a good move on the SDP and uh it's a it's a very uh compelling argument so we come back to the point of performance of the candidates and the party's performance so government must show must I think make uh recognise that uh one big factor is the Fanner's concept that people now have you know and the fact that government has reformed today you know it's going to make that an e even more important factor that you got to appear to be fair I like to take up a point that Bilveer raise which is that uh the issues are very different this tim eI think he's right on that score the issues are different but it does not make the election easier precisely because more people in the constituencies will be able to take the view well if we have a few more opposition members in parliament what is so wrong with that uh that's going to be a factor in this coming elections I think the other point that many people will have to consider would what kind of manifestos are the opposition parties coming up with the concept of gracious society is in a way within the PAP's manifesto I think unless the opposition is not conscious So are you saying then there really aren't any clear differences between the manifestos of the opposition and the PAP Bet you PAP will disagree with that But i would I would tend to say that the PAP have been very successful in hijacking many of the opposition parties' manifestos especially when it come to talking of uh the lower classes talking about the poorer people I think this caring compassionate society has been very successfully uh modelled on by Mr Goh and it's really I think going to deliver That's one I'm coming to the by-election strategy I think people are confused you know you have not run your GE you're already talking about your by-election That's one I think Number two it was mainly to overcome two basic arguments one was the SDP call for treating it as a by-election Number two was the J.B.J. problem and the fact that he chose to address it people amy argue that eh ther's something in it you know you just can't dismiss it as a ploy a tactic and I think people are beginning to think seriously about it and that that maybe this is an afterthought rather than really something thought through and that may in fact hurt Mr Goh in th long run Do you see the issues changing over the next ten days of the campaign you know anything can happen from Nomination Day to Polling Day but uh that's a a gen a general truth I would argue but uh my sense said i would not feel that fundamental of a change I think there will be basically quite low-key unless the opposition is able to come on with something out of their head But Mr Goh has draw has drawn the ground rules in the sense by pitting himself as the centre of this arena so it will be about mr Goh this time but perhaps uh longer run the worry will be a about Mr Goh's political role within the neighbourhood in uh ASEAN and so on the opposition parties need to come out more strongly with uh manifestos in respect of where they want Singapore go in the future Well I think it's not a manifesto bad backward all you know because the positions have have already closed uh closed closed up the the the uh endorsement of of mr Goh and uh I think he has a lot of goodwill and a lot of people will vote for him but that would that could be uh negated to some extent by local issues like constituencies and how the uh the candidates uh look because the uh I think Singaporeans become more sophisticated now they they do not accept the argument that unless I have a the PAP has a bigger mandate in percentage terms is going to be bad for the country so it's not that black and white [lah] Now while though the local issues are important at this particular time in point somehow or another they have been made quite insignificant by the fact that there is a call and the call is where does Mr Goh stand not just now maybe in the next decade or so I think that's very pressing well the last election was described as a watershed election now if you had to describe this one in just one word what would you say Peter we'll start with you Turning point Legitimacy Mr Goh's election Thank you gentlemen for your views well tomorrow the hustings begin with political rallies and dialogue sessions the campaign will continue for nine days after which you decide who to give your vote to good night </X> </I>"

A: Many of you may be wondering what an Open University is like
A: Well Britain has had an Open University for the last twenty years"
265,"A: Well Britain has had an Open University for the last twenty years
A: Let's take a look at how their system works
A: The British Open University's supposed to serve as a model for ours but peculiarities of the Singapore environment will also have to be considered
A: And to discuss just what the Open University here should be like I have with me in the studio four panelists Mr Liew Syn Paw Member of Parliament for Tanglin and GPC Chairman for Education Dr Gwee Ee Hian long-standing educationist of forty-two years and also Executive Director of the Singapore Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry Dr Seet Ai Mee who've spent three months at the Institute of South-east Asian studies doing research on an Open University and because educational poli policies have always had an impact on employment we have Mr George Abraham Honorary Secretary-General of the Singapore Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry to give the employers' perspective
A: Also joining us in tonight's discussion are former students of the British Open University local graduates and non-graduates as well as professionals
A: Well we've what the British Open University model is like uh what can the Singapore Open University be like and what can it do for this society
A: Mr Liew <unclear> word </unclear> you'd like to begin"
266,"D: I think the Open University can do this effectively
D: I don't think you level up by pulling the people at the top
D: The levelling up has to be moving the people at the bottom up to a sec to a to a higher notch and I think this uh Open University will be performing this as its major role for society
A: Uhm Mr Abraham what would the employers' point of view be
E: I think the most important factor is that it provides flexibility to a system that is usually seen to be rigid
E: It allows people to learn at their own pace
A: Uhm"
267,"A: A common reason suggested is that more women are working now and their husbands are no longer <unclear> word </unclear> so divorce becomes an easy option
A: But is that the main reason for the increasing divorce rate or is the situation more complex than that
A: To discuss this and other issues I have with me an audience of social workers sociologists lawyers and people who are divorced
A: Mr Kenneth Chen MP for Hong Kah GRC is also joining us for the discussion
A: Mr Chen by the way is happily married with two children
A: But first let's get back uh get back to you Rosaline
B: Uh"
268,"C: I think that is a myth and we must realise that it is not easy to live intimately with another person for a long period of time
C: The other reality I suppose is that when we have any kind of change in society you're bound to have all kinds of pressures on this type of relationship and when people change they have options they have other ways of looking at things
C: Then they may also not become very tolerant when they live together and I think that also contributes to a part of the decision-making
A: Uh Nirmala uh Mr Yeo mentioned the that people have this romantic view towards marriage and uh sometimes it's not fulfilled this romantic side of view that they have
A: Would you agree with that
D: Yes to some extent
D: Uh again it I I agree with him that uh one can't just look for one single cause"
269,"A: Let me begin with you Ekachai
A: Now you work with Action Theatre and you've been performing on part-time basis and as I understand doing quite well
A: Now what are you doing actually to bring in the audience
B: Uhm well there's I think there's no secret formula but uhm for Action Theatre I think the fact that our group comprises a lot of professionals somehow the way we go about uhm doing marketing our product we tend to have uhm I think what we call a twin focus approach
B: I think you need to focus both on the creative side of the business uh and also the business side of marketing the art uhm so I think that that's that's how we begin so far
A: Okay so you've been quite successful then
B: Uhm"
270,"D: But the audience are not educated to appreciate other racial arts you see
D: The the problem become so acute in the sense that we are being expose to Western theatre Western and the type of education and I guess sad to say that a lot of people appreciate ballet more or a lot of people go to to see opera more even if they don't under understand the language
A: Okay sorry to interrupt Robert yes
E: Yah I think the uhm mountain efforts is not really what I would call project specific
E: Marketing effort is a sustain effort
E: For example if you look at the so called quote unquote popularity of foreign shows that are brought in here I think one doesn't realise that the foreign shows that are being brought in have already expended an enormous amount of time and money in promoting themselves before even got here
E: And also whereas we tend I think in Singapore to look at it from a project to project basis in the mean time you know between performances between productions we really don't see this effort being maintained"
271,"A: Do we have enough of those people uh that sponsors are looking for John
A: So there is an overkill
I: Are you saying that sponsors should only sponsor the man and not the boys
A: Sorry uhm Ekachai go ahead
B: I think it has a lot to do more with the quality of the artistic product I think part-time necessary does not necessarily equal amateurish
B: In fact I think in the way our our cultures cultural scene is growing there are a lot of part-time groups that are producing very very quality uh good quality work compared to say product say professional companies
B: Professional companies are constraint by the fact that they have to come up with a season"
272,"A: To discuss this I have with me experts and laymen both single and married Mr K Shanmugam who's the MP for the Sembawang GRC is also with us tonight
A: I also have with me two people who typify married people and single people
A: Let's start with you Terry
A: You're a bachelor and you've got many friends who are also singles
A: Why do you think singles are delaying marriage
B: Well I'm not sure if I actually typify the actual bachelor so I'll just say this for myself but you find that uhm in many situation they they people are being pushed to excel in their career they want to go places they want to travel they want to get experience in working overseas and things like that don't work very well when you are actually within a marriage when you got uhm a wife and two kids to bring along with you and I think that tends to put people uh to make people want to push marriage further until they've actually gone through that kind of thing
A: Weng Hee as a married man do you think that his points are valid"
273,"A: Let's start with you Terry
A: You're a bachelor and you've got many friends who are also singles
A: Why do you think singles are delaying marriage
B: Well I'm not sure if I actually typify the actual bachelor so I'll just say this for myself but you find that uhm in many situation they they people are being pushed to excel in their career they want to go places they want to travel they want to get experience in working overseas and things like that don't work very well when you are actually within a marriage when you got uhm a wife and two kids to bring along with you and I think that tends to put people uh to make people want to push marriage further until they've actually gone through that kind of thing
A: Weng Hee as a married man do you think that his points are valid
C: Yes basically I would agree with what Terry has said but I'd like to add on and say that Singaporeans these days aspire to a standard of living characterized by material comfort and a lot of independence a lot of freedom and as a result they now perceive marriage as an institution which will impose on their financial well-being and on their independence
C: Hence uh they'll want to have a good life they want to achieve before they finally settle down"
274,"A: Is there really too much sex on Singapore stage
B: Well I think that uh I mean I've been looking at the at the clips right and two of the plays were directed by myself
A: That's why that's why we brought you here
B: Yah and uhm I suppose I'm more incline to what's the big deal because I feel that uh at this moment Singaporean theatre is still exploring you know so it's really of a a virgin I mean we are we are uhm we've been doing Singlish in Singaporean theatre for the last uh five six years in a very intense way uhm and if we start dictating right now what to write to the playwright I think that we are self-censoring to
A: Your <unclear> word </unclear> but the question is why exploring just the sexual themes there are so many other things
B: I think that then it must be important enough to the playwrights you see because maybe sexuality is an important concern uh for many young people because they they see that uh as a a as an identity uh as a a a a a a a way in which they can talk about other themes for instance
A: Oh let's check with the playwright"
275,"B: Well I think that uh I mean I've been looking at the at the clips right and two of the plays were directed by myself
A: That's why that's why we brought you here
B: Yah and uhm I suppose I'm more incline to what's the big deal because I feel that uh at this moment Singaporean theatre is still exploring you know so it's really of a a virgin I mean we are we are uhm we've been doing Singlish in Singaporean theatre for the last uh five six years in a very intense way uhm and if we start dictating right now what to write to the playwright I think that we are self-censoring to
A: Your <unclear> word </unclear> but the question is why exploring just the sexual themes there are so many other things
B: I think that then it must be important enough to the playwrights you see because maybe sexuality is an important concern uh for many young people because they they see that uh as a a as an identity uh as a a a a a a a way in which they can talk about other themes for instance
A: Oh let's check with the playwright
A: Is that true"
276,"A: Are you avant-garde
B: There's divide there's divide
B: I don't think there is so much avant-garde but I think that the problem right now is that Singaporean society is so reactionary you see
B: I feel I feel that artiste just need to have some leeway to explore to explore issues but as soon as issues are explored there is a big hue and cry and suddenly it explodes in our faces into something which which very soon I think laws and regulations will be created to blunt us
D: This this is my point as well you see
D: My point is also that if or if if there is if the debate is structured in these terms then then it becomes a case where you are you have an either or situation
D: If you are if you are critical of of of sex and the arts then you are necessarily you know pushed into the camp of of the conservatives"
277,"A: I mean uh kids sort of boy-girl relationships there's part of the normal process of growing up right so what would you be concerned about
D: I think I'm more concerned about the rising trend of abortion and uh promiscuity among the young and also the rising trend of suicide among the teenagers too
D: There are quite a number of other problems stresses from uhm pressures of school work uhm what else
A: Okay yah sorry
C: I was I feel that there are are other symptoms that we need to identify
C: I have increasing contact with parents that that indicates that uh the youth begins to show rebellion before they are ten or begin to ask for their freedom uh before their teenage years uh well in advance two three years in advance of their so called teenage years you know
C: So there are some symptoms uh that need to be recognise by the parents early uh and one of them is rebellion in the home"
278,"B: And once you give them a chance and if they can show that they can responsibility for themselves and also for the family and the society at large and then they can slowly let go
C: But I I think the the the best way is to uh get uhm through whether it be professional assistance of not but I feel that the parents themselves have ability to bridge that gap
C: It has to be both ways where the parents move toward the problem teenager and the teenager uh at least uh understanding their their needs to be some compromise and they have to work towards each other
A: If they're given and yah given that okay uh a teenager who is going through a this kind of phase that's not uh sort of so called normal uhm is not likely to want to listen to his parents anyway or to any authority figure
A: Uhm is it really realistic to say that we can help the teenager bridge the gap
A: Do you think it's realistic
C: I think yes uh I think teenagers are looking for someone who's willing to listen to what they have to say rather than always have to listen to someone"
279,"C: Now that's very interesting because almost one hundred per cent of all the teenagers we deal with uh indicate that they wish their parents won't nag at them
C: You know in some way not uh just by verbal nagging but they wish that their parents would would be more listening than just
D: more understanding
C: Ah yah and display understanding rather than just tell them
B: So what you're saying is that the parent should be encouraged uh to take the youth through a process of analysing their problem and then they can act as resource persons
C: Exactly yes
B: And it is up to the youth themselves to make the decision as to"
280,"D: Quite often uh you find that uh parents are also too quick to judge
D: Uh they will say the friends that you go with are not very suitable and teens having friends they find their friends important and they find them that is good
D: Uh so parents need to handle these issues sensitively
A: Yah what about okay what about a parent who has never uhm been able to communicate with his or her child has never had the experience of developing that relationship what can that parent do
A: Is it I mean is that sort of relationship beyond redemption
A: Would you ever say that there are cases which are beyond redemption
C: I don't uh state uh that there's there are cases beyond redemption because I've seen many parents get surprise at themselves uh that they had the ability to actually work toward"
281,"A: There's this organisation in the States called Tough Love which helps parents sort of take a stand with their teenagers and stick to it sort of lay down the law as it were
A: Uhm do you think something like that could work in Singapore Ngee
D: Uh it's very good approach but I don't think it is suited for our culture because what Tough Love advocates is a kind of taking a tough stand letting your kid face the consequences and letting your kid go <X>
D: Parents are not ready for that and like Wah Khoon said their their kid is too precious
C: I feel Tough Love uh only works on a very strong uh bond in in a relationship There has to be a strong bond because uh some of our teenagers in Singapore react at the slighest provocation
B: I think I want to say uh a word on behalf of the parents Parents are human beings they have fears and they are afraid that their teenagers would go astray and in the Singapore context a lot of the parents are very afraid that their children would neglect their studies and that will mar their future So therefore I feel that teenagers should uhm assure their parents and take constructive step to let their parents know in what way are they taking measures and not to neglect their studies to take care of themselves when they go out or when they're staying overnight so that the parents fears can be allayed </X> </I>"
282,"C: Well as I said before you see you are trying to tell them not to be kiasu but you have no control over how they view it
C: Will they be taking it as a lesson yes it's something we shouldn't do or it's something that well it's something that we should emulate so
B: I think we should uh sorry I think we should give credit to young people even children uh sometimes we tend to think that they get easily influenced by comics
B: We all grow up by watching Popeye the sailor and we haven't become started speaking like Popeye
A: Okay okay thank you thank you very much I think with that we've come to the end of this part of the discussion and it's clear that kiasu promotions are meant to allow us to laugh at ourselves at least that's the intention and yes I think we we we need to do more of that but the problem is are we celebrating a behaviour that's not that funny that selfish inconsiderate behaviour
A: Well I know you're raring to tell us some of your own personal encounters okay the number to call is six nine one one three double zero that's six nine one one three zero zero
A: Just keep dialing that number we want to hear your experiences with the kiasus after this break(Phone-in interviews)"
283,"C: So I think we have to be very distinctive about what we called the kiasuism and what is being called being prepared in terms of some kind of working strategies
A: Would would you say that uh some Singaporeans are using this as a crutch as it were for lack of better way of putting it for their own inadequacies but blaming other people who are hardworking by calling them kiasu
C: Oh yes I would think so because as a matter of fact you find that the people have been using the word kiasu so loosely I would say that we have to think very carefully as what is their definition of kiasu because I think that there could be ten different definitions for kiasu according to what the person wants
A: Yah talking about definitions Suresh did you take into account this this this point when you came up with the books
B: Our understanding of kiasu is someone who wants to win at all cost
B: A person who works hard I'll give you an example perhaps the Olympic games Carl Lewis and Ben Johnson Karl Lewis wants to win
B: Perhaps he trains twelve hours a day Ben Johnson also wants to win but he uses an unfair method uses drugs"
284,"F: These are actually very broad terms which can cover a wide multitude of tasks for example and therefore <unclear> word </unclear> it is difficult to draw parameters as to what exactly constitute the task that should be done
F: So because of this there could be difficulties uh by interpreting what should be the parameters for her job
F: I think additional another point to be made also is that in reference to a call that was made earlier on about how when you pay two fifty then you expect to get that much service out of her
F: It it has got to be realised is and and this is a point that has been made by Doctor Nirmala PuruShotam who is research on the subject
F: Now actually what is happening when you employ your maid is that you actually moving from house work that was done for free by the woman of the house that is the wife and the mother to now uhm work that you have to pay for
F: In other words you're actually paying two hundred and fifty dollars and and more because if if you take in consideration board and lodgings where previously it was serviced without a fee
D: Doctor Chua do you think why do you think that kind of mentality arises I mean as a psychologist"
285,"B: Hi we are acting now because we are afraid of Brenda
B: I don't feel too well now also

C: I said what carry on but I like being chauvinist and somehow or rather the female friends I mix with seem to like my chauvinism in that area at least you know
A: Janice
B: Which is how I feel actually men are quite confused you know
B: Uhm on the one hand they're expected to now be sensitive and emotional and those are very good I mean those are the things that keep a relationship alive"
318,"B: At the same time the woman also I think I think if if if I can be used as an example I'm just your average woman right we also want the men to remain protective
B: We also want the maleness you know of the men to come through so while I want him to learn to share his emotions with me to learn to to to nurturing and everything uhm I think I also have a responsibility to in teaching him how to bring it out because you can't just say the man has to change full stop and I am a woman and I demand this
B: I know I depend on my husband for all the practical things in life
B: Uhm he depends on me for the emotional support that I can give you know so it's it's a partnership [lah] you know
D: I I come to think in the sense it's sad lah you know
D: I don't think we should just focus on men's changing you know because men has to change in relation to something and it's in realism to the changing expectations of women as well of <unclear> word </unclear> even other men
D: So I I agree with you in that sense I mean it has to be something mutual and I also agree that there is this confusion that is setting because with all the demands of men to change sometimes the man is not quite sure as to what he ought to be you see at the end of the day and that may add to the confusion I suppose"
319,"B: We also want the maleness you know of the men to come through so while I want him to learn to share his emotions with me to learn to to to nurturing and everything uhm I think I also have a responsibility to in teaching him how to bring it out because you can't just say the man has to change full stop and I am a woman and I demand this

A: But do you personally feel confused"
320,"A: It's time for a commercial break we'll be back
A: Before the break we are talking about how confused we poor men are
A: Bob and I have two things in common at least
A: We're both bachelors and both of us have been scolded by women for opening car doors and other doors for them
A: Anthony in the other hand have has seen men being scolded for not opening doors for women
A: So Janice what do you women want
B: I don't know"
321,"A: Middle ground
B: I enjoy being a woman
A: Okay <X>
B: But that doesn't mean I enjoy being trampled on by the men There are certain roles I think of the men has to play just as there are certain roles that a woman plays is just you know it's just the way of the world right And which is not so that if he cries he's being less of a man but there are certain things a certain take chargeness uhm a woman I think must feel that she can depend on her man you know not to fall to pieces in a crisis to be able to make decisions for the family if they cannot reach some Somebody has to you know to to to be a leader to be to be the person that you can depend on He is the person that uhm there's certain male attributes that he should have [lah] you know
A: Is it
D: That's that's not necessary that's not necessary being male you know I think I think it is
A: And apart from that is it unfair burden to the poor guy"
322,"B: Because if you were to wait for the down turn you know you maybe never be able to get the property that you like
B: So it really depends on your own personal what you think and the other thing that is very important is your cash flow you know whether your monthly income is able to service the kind of properties that you are buying at <X>
B: Martin </X>
B: Yah I think so <X>
B: Martin </X>
A: For investment meaning that you want to buy to let out
A: At the same time perhaps in a few year's time to sell for capital gain"
323,"A: So for Singapore companies when we team up with larger uh companies or when you seek the path of a a listing for instance to get more capital is to equip ourselves for globalisation
A: So when you companies uh teaming up or uh selling out to bigger uh group is because of the products that they have that they are ready to globalise and you need to take that path <X>
A: Martin </X>
B: Yah I I I tend to agree with Dr Onmae that you know there is a need to emphasize the other aspects rather than pure manufacturing
B: If you look at Singapore's history where have been good
B: Where have we been strong
B: We are good traders we are good builders of domestic we have built a very good lifestyle for ourselves"
324,"B: Uhm perhaps you are not so focussed
B: That's that's quite important to be quite focussed in what you want to do <X>
B: Martin </X>
A: Yah I think you have state entrepreneurship already existing very much in Singapore <X>
A: Martin </X>
A: What if you have to ask yourself whether you are needed in considering whether you you want to be an entrepreneur or not than I think you shouldn't be an entrepreneur to begin with <X>
A: Martin </X>"
325,"A: Now I I would disagree I would disagree with that view totally
A: I think we should not take it as a given that Singapore society is going to have this high level of intolerance for failure we should take it as a given and therefore we just praise uhm and try to nurture those entrepreneurs who have made it
A: I think history has shown that a lot of entrepreneurs will finally become successful were not successful initially
A: And I think the the the the crux of the problem really is with the educational system uhm an educational system which on one hand I think we should certainly we should certainly promote meritocracy we should give a lot of attention to achievement orientation but there should not be that collorary stigma attached to failure
A: I think in educational system today we have a lot of young people who at a very age already think they're washed out and they're failures
A: Luckily I think educational system is changing today so that those people who are not like to <unclear> word </unclear> that much uh to do that well in in grades and academically now probably can find other areas where entrepreneurial flair can be developed
A: They can go to fashion school"
326,"A: What did what is appropriate
A: Who decides what's appropriate
C: Uhm that was my question to you
A: Yah
A: Elaine
B: When you said appropriate what do you mean by

327,"A: Elaine
B: When you said appropriate what do you mean by
C: He asked the question
A: Yah yah I mean for whom is it appropriate
A: Who decides whether this is permissible or not
B: Maybe you should have a body that actually regulates
A: Another body to regulate"
328,"D: So you're agreeing with me that Singlish is is
C: I am not
A: Okay perhaps perhaps we we may not be getting anywhere if we use terms like incorrect because incorrect is really subjective incorrect in what sense
A: Uh if you're using grammar as a as a yardstick yah perhaps in it is it isn't correct
A: But if you are suggesting that oh if we can agree that it is something that's been evolving naturally in Singapore then
C: I have to suggest that
A: We have to see it from a different point of view"
329,"D: I'll be very serious
C: May I set a language example that a hundred years ago a word like perambulator was the standard form usage of what we now know as pram and you know you might a hundred years ago it would be absolutely correct to say excuse me but could you please move your perambulator but now we say excuse me please move your pram

B: Either we use it or we don't in the on the media yah
A: Jacintha
A: Can we agree on something on this issue
C: I totally agree that the use of Singlish has to be taken in whatever context me uhm and therefore uh when you say it's use in certain situations it's absolutely correct to use certain in a court I wouldn't say to the judge uh I wouldn't speak Singlish to the judge we have to use"
331,"A: If you may I'd just like to go to them too
A: Hi you're with Talking Point

C: Yes I am Raymond Yip

332,"D: Hi this is Joanne Yap
D: I'm calling about this third child issue because I'm currently expecting my third child and she's due to arrive already in January but up to now I'm quite surprised to find out that the government is not supporting us with any maternity leave at all
D: So I really hope that the government body would try and impose this rule so that <unclear> word </unclear> because knowing that if nobody should say it's a compulsory thing no companies would give it to any mothers
D: This is a fact so if the government can look at it it's like a <unclear> word </unclear> thing like uhm if a women having a third child goes away on maternity they can somehow get some kind of maybe like rebates from the government or whatsoever then <unclear> word </unclear> encourage women to have more children I guess
A: Okay thank you very much for joining us thank you
A: So we've a situation where the government is saying this there's just not enough people having babies so like scholars said you know it's like national service

333,"A: We have another caller though joining us
A: Hi you're with Talking Point
A: May I know who is that please
F: Okay I'm Chandra from Telok Blangah calling
A: Hi Chandra
F: Yes my point is that uh you know there are so much emphasis on children and all that nowadays
F: And if the mother is not at home to look after the kid I think I'm afraid there is this problem of latch-key kids coming up here"
334,"F: Thank you
A: Thank you
F: Bye bye
A: So even if we solved the problem by getting your employers to uh somehow you find a way to lobby that uhm you're still spending time away from work uh away from your child
A: At the same time you also need to work because you need to earn the income for your child
A: What are we looking at then you know we have this conflicting uhm aspirations in in women nowadays
A: You know they want to work and want to have a child"
335,"D: I think that is the point
C: Okay that's one issue Now are there any other limitations with the C P I as an index
C: Shi Teck
D: Yah I think the C P I is a general uh indicator
D: It doesn't a a person or a family at any point in time say if you're buying a house or if you're buying a car your C your car is due for new C O E then the impact on you will be higher
D: Or you are you have aged parents or you have students that go to universities so your feeling of the cost of living that has gone up is much higher than the general indicator
D: So the C P I should be take taken as a general indicator and it has its limitations"
336,"B: All of them
D: I think all the four
C: All of them equally equally uh important
B: Yah yes but I think that it is also important they want to consider cost increases To think about income increases as well And if you look at the perspective of let's say the last ten years I think incomes have risen faster than cost Standards of living have indeed improved
D: And I think that that's one thing that the Singaporeans must uh pay tribute to the government I mean all of us have actually improved in the quality of life

F: Uh Mr Goh Eunos factor how much of it could have been due to feeling amongst Malay voters that you've came up too hard against him for instance the use of inshallah and so on in the speeches by Jufrie
A: You see that's what worries me because if I don't come down hard on a candidate using communal line then they would have gone even much further in this election and because I came down hard that put a stop to it
A: I do not know about this use of inshaallah whether that annoyed the Malays or not uh I mean I don't quite understand fully uh the proper occasions to use such phrases maybe it's annoyed quite a few people
A: Uh Wong Kan Seng's remarks could have perhaps caused some misunderstanding on on on a the use of such religious phrases but could you imagine when the crowd is excited after listening to a to a to a rally speech and then the use of religious phrases I think that could evoke very strong gut feel in the Malays"

A: I'm not saying that the use of the phrases is wrong but I'm saying that in the right in the wrong occasion it could lead to more problems
C: So far as we can tell because we brought this out into the open and took a strong stand against Jufrie the ground move in our favour the ground meaning both the Chinese voters as well as the Malay voters"

F: Uh may I just uh supplement uh what uh my Minister of State Senior Minister of State has said uhm answer to Mr Chiam's question I understand it's his favourite question and it's uh something worth debating Now in in looking at the education system we have a tendency in Singapore to look towards the west US UK and so on and some of the opposition leaders uh members might have been teachers before so they had certain philosophies built into them If you have been following the press uh in UK for example recently they have come up with a new study you know the Education Secretaries' come up with new study to show that in fact they were for many years for generations influenced so much by this so-called Powden Report which says you should never teach a child you should let him discover by himself you know you should not even have prop uh uh structured learning and so on As a result of this the education system in UK has been blighted for generations and now they're trying to recover So you must see this in perspective if you want to study and try and improve the education system We must also compare the situation in nuh Japan the situation in nuh Korea Taiwan and so on And as a let me finish first let me finish first as has been mentioned by uh Dr Tay in fact the class size in Japan and Taiwan are forty fifty and even above In Singapore's case our class size standard size is forty Some schools have less In fact the average figure for secondary schools is about thirty six pupils per class Now those schools that are less popular tend to have smaller classes the popular ones tend to have big classes sometimes as big as forty four and the results are better uh So it is not so much the class size alone Let's not over-emphasise this point If you want to uh reduce class size for example you go from forty to twenty as uh advocated by Mr Chiam you will have to increase number of teachers by two Instead of twenty thousand teachers you need to have forty thousand teachers Where do we find the number of teachers And what is the value of so doing I mean if you teach in front of a class of uh twenty or class of forty what's the difference You're teaching right Of course if you want to have a interactive method then it's better to have a smaller class size But you must remember that sometimes when you interact with the pupils in fact you may be spending more time with one pupil at the expense of the whole class and that is the problem that's been discovered in the western system The problem also with the western system is that the children tend to be very undisciplined While the teacher is teaching the class would be you know playing basketball behind or something Our situation is very different Our pupils are very disciplined and they want to learn and their parents want them to learn So we've discovered that in fact with a class size of forty we are doing very well and we should be proud of the results that we've achieving year after year I think we compare very well with international standards and personally I'm amazed at number of students who score straight As in 'O' levels uh 'A' levels and so on </X> </I>"

440,"A: Sir I would like to know the minister's views in these areas
B: Mr Yeo
C: Thank you Mr Speaker Sir
C: Sir both Mr Abdullah Tarmugi and uh Dr Michael Lim have raised questions on the disabled
C: Sir the government's policy towards the uh disabled is to help them to live independently so as in order
C: sorry is to enable them to live independently as far as it's compatible with their capabilities
C: This would enable them to look after themselves as to lessen the burden on the family"
441,"C: And would be of great help to disabled to the uh disabled
C: Sir historically the voluntary sector has been in the forefront of provision of services for the disabled
C: They have done extremely well and should be con should be encouraged to continue to do so
C: We will assist them as far as possible to provide improved and expanded [ah] programs
C: Now through the concerted efforts of both government and the VWOs a wide range of services and facilities have already been implemented
C: This include special education vocational training and rehabilitation vocational assessment and job placement production at sheltered workshops day-care hostels and residential care
C: Mr Tarmugi has asked in terms of what are we providing to the uh to the disabled"
442,"C: The Bees Link Centre as I mentioned has the uh job placement centre
C: The centre has already placed out two hundred and twenty seven uh disabled people in uh various companies
C: There're also other schemes for example uh the there's a scheme whereby employers who are taking in disabled people are helped through a subsidy that's provided by uh that's provided by the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry
C: Under this scheme employers who employ disabled [ah] can have the first one and a half months salary of the disabled paid through a fund which is provided by the Chamber
C: Uh so this this way it allows the employers who are who have never had the experience of employing disabled to take in disabled for a trial period
C: And they're assured that for the first one and a half months the salaries are borne by this fund
C: We also provide tax incentives to employers who make work site modifications in order to accommodate the uh disabled"
443,"C: I think I've I've replied to most of his points under the under the disabled
C: Sir I move on to the aged population
C: Both Mr Tarmugi and Dr Michael Lim have also have spoken on the aged <X>
C: Sir the aged is an issue which should concern all of us that is because our aged population will increase very significantly Today only nine percent of our population are aged above sixty By the by the year twenty thirty about one in four of our population would be above the age of sixty and one there'll be one aged to two persons in the working age group of fifteen to sixteen So I think this is a problem which is of uh which will have great significance uh and great and and uh many implications for society in Singapore Now what is heartening and important to note is that fortunately most elderly are actually healthy Our studies show that about ninety three percent of elderly are fit active and healthy Only five percent are frail and about two percent are bed-ridden Sir because of the large number of elderly that we'll be having in the uh future the responsibility for caring for the aged falls on all of us everyone the family the community the government and the aged themselves Sir in lloking after the aged we must preserve the family as the best social insurance for its members because by the year twenty twenty thirty even if we want to we won't be able to find enough economically active people to lookj after the aged because the numbers the number of the uh aged will be so great Sir the family setting allows the aged to grow old graciously in familiar surroundings and therefore help them to maintain their self-worth and dignity The our programs are therefore directed towards helping them to live within the community Sir Mr Tarmugi has asked in terms of caring for the aged sick and poor what is the amount of health uh what are we doing in terms of providing health facilities and uh in terms of helping us to meet the needs of the elderly what sort of institutional what sort what are we doing in terms of providing inti in uh insitutional care and in terms of helping them to live within the com the community Sir our programs which are aimed at helping the aged to live within the the uh families and the community are aimed at promoting self-help or mutual help because for every frail elderly there'll be at least twenty fit and healthy elderly So whilst we have very few working people to help look after the elderly in the future we must not forget we'll have a large number of very fit and healthy uh older person who should then participate in helping to look after themselves Sir the success of our programs to help the aged depends on uh how the public perceives and perceives the aged in the process of aging and how they accept the aged I think there's a tendency to perceive the aged as being sickly dependent and decrepit We must change such an sttitude if we are going to be able to encourage more members of the public to come forward to participate in uh providing assistance to the uh to the elderly So what the gov the government is doing is that we are having a annual public awareness and public educaiton program on the aged in order to enhance the level of awareness of the population Now the highlight of this program is is our Senior Citizens' Day and uh I'm glad to say that the program has been quite successful because the level of participation in our Senior Citizens' Day's program at both the national and the constituency level are have been increasing Sir in terms of for the aged relief alone my family run uh my Ministry runs a befriender service scheme which helps to recruit volunteers and matches them to the Senior citizens The volunteers befriend advise and assist the aged to cope with their daily demands of living within the community because it is important for us to encourage and to assist the elderly to live within the community and to only be uh obtaining institutional care as a matter of last reort In line with that we also have the uh Home Nursing Foundation assisted by the Ministry of Health which provides a home nursing service and trains members in the care of their aged dependents WE also provide uh screening and medical counselling in such centres Sir the Singapore Action Group of Elders uh also has established a hot-line and counselling service for the aged and uh they are able to provide advice counselling and referral uh services for the elderly who are who are who require such services Mr Speaker: Mr Yeo we are running out of time on this amendment Mr Yeo Cheow Tong: Okay Yes Sir Mr Speaker: You you Mr Yeo Cheow Tong: Sir so in terms of helping them to live within the community we have a lot of programs In terms of institutional care we will also be there're there're already adequate nursing homes and uh other facilities uh we will be helping the VWOs increase the number of uh places in the homes to meet the requirements for the for the coming yeasr by funding eighty percent of the cost of these new facilities In terms of uh recurring expenses we will also be helping them Sir we we will therefore be making sure that we have enough institutional uh facilities uh to to help look after those who require institutional care Sir let me move on to uh the issue of public assistance Sir the public assistance scheme is meant to help the financially distressed to regain their independence It's not meant as an unemployment retirement or disability allowance Sir we grant uh allowances to the aged destitues the disabled and the chronically sick the orphans and the widows Sir the the scheme has to be stringent I know members are not very comfortable with or some members are not comfortable with that but our scheme has to be stringent in order to encourage the able body to re to uh rely on themselves and not to rely on the dole Sir if we don't that don't do that then I think we 're heading down the slippery road to uh disaster On no one in Singapore is denied the opportunity to apply for PA Sir but whilst we open the door for all to apply I think we must be careful to ensure that whilst we have a soft heart we don't have a soft head because as Dr Lim has mentioned some members in his constituencies feel shy about applying They feel that it's a shameful thing to do Sir I think it's not at all a bad emotion because if they are if they feel that it is degrading to apply and therefore they re they are able to rely on their own other mechanisms as well as to rely on other organizations to help them I think it's a it's a very good thing We should Dr Michael Lim: Speaker Sir can I just clarify Well uh my point is that uh they've actually applied and uh they have uh actually been interviewed and have been accepted for the scheme but uh because of the following the interview they felt that it was as if they were begging and therefore they declined their assistance and came to us for assistance but our assistance is limited Mr Yeo: But they've gone ahead to apply and they have been interviewed then why have they withdrawn the application Sir the the key thing is now the key thing is we want to be sure that only those who are genuinely in need and who are unable to find other forms of assistance apply for PA assistance That must be the basis and for those who have applied they we must subject them to some interviewing to ensure these are the genuine cases I think there's no other way Sir for us to sort out the genuine from the non-genuine But i can assure uh members that the interviews are done very professionally they're non-threatening they're in no way meant to embarrass the applicants and also the data and information gathered are treated very confidentially Sir when I'm when I uh went into MCD I made sure that all rejections were seen by me to ensure that the rejections were valid I'm glad to say that in all rejections in in all rejection cases while I was in MCD and before that the uh rejections were valid because the applicants really upon investigation were found that they have either adequate savings of their own or they were actually being supported by their families by their children relatives So all the cases were rejected on good grounds Sir Mr Speaker: Mr Yeo Mr Yeo: Sir but nonetheless Mr Speaker: Would you like to wind up your answer Mr Yeo: Okay Sir what uh what we want to stress is that the PA scheme is adequate we do review the rates we do ensure that the the uh PA allowances are adequate to ensure that the PA recipients are able to survive and more moreover more importantly we also on top of the PA scheme are able to draw on other resources to help the uh recipients Dr Michael LIm: Uh Speaker Sir can I just add one last statement Uh it appears it appears that my twenty nine year old uh housewife with three children will not find solace in your answer uh perhaps uh Minister before he just ends would like to make a comment about the proposal I made with regards to the widowed woman with the children Mr Yeo: Sir I'm not familiar with his twenty nine year old uh widow the case of the twenty nine year old widow if he feels that the the uh widow has got good grounds he shoudl as MP write in to reappeal and I'm sure my my my [ah] offi officials would uh reconsider In terms of his uh his suggestion that we we channel the PA grants through the CCCs Sir I'm that in the first place that his CCC uh was able to provide some help I think that's a right way to go The the payment of the PA allowance through the POSB is a very convenient one It imposes no inconvenience on the recipients Mr Speaker: Mr Yeo I think you've answered Mr Dr Lim already Mr Tarmugi Is member given leave to withdraw his amendment Amendment withdrawn

466,"B: It was diluted by the well by the workers when I was there

B: They treat non-surgical conditions of the nervous system"
471,"A: I see
A: So you confirm doctor that you examined this patient and you found that there is a bruising on his brain

A: Now how severe was this injury
B: It was sufficient to cause changes on the C T scan which were of a temporary nature
B: But not sufficient to cause bleeding inside the brain my Lord"
472,"B: That is correct my Lord
A: Now how severe was this injury
B: It was sufficient to cause changes on the C T scan which were of a temporary nature
B: But not sufficient to cause bleeding inside the brain my Lord

A: You mention here that he was found to have some problem of co-ordination
A: Now what type of problem would you classify that as"
473,"A: He had some problem of co-ordination
A: How severe and what characteristic would these problems of co-ordination would be
B: He would have difficulty in performing a number of sequential actions that is moving in an ordered sequence learnt movement
B: My Lord the technical word for this is dyspraxia D Y S P R A X I A which means
A: Now in this report you also mentioned that the C T scan did not show any blood clot inside the skull
A: Now this was done in nineteen eighty-two
B: No"
474,"B: I want to distinguish between a contusion and a hemorrhage
A: Just to reconfirm that I got what you have said
A: At the time of the accident you examined him and there was a contusion in the brain
B: I examined the C T scan my Lord
A: Ya that is right
B: That showed the contusion
A: Correct"
475,"B: The patient had symptoms of a contusion
A: How long will this contusion last
A: I mean does it stay on forever
B: The appearance my Lord on the x-ray on the C T scan would be obvious for a week few weeks or few months
B: Just like a bruise it would disappear but the effects on the brain may last for a considerably longer period
A: Now I refer you to the last report which is sixth of September eighty-three
A: In paragraph two you have reported that you have examined him on the seventh of August nineteen eighty-three and that he was found to have in-co-ordination of the right side of his body"
476,"A: Now I refer you to the last report which is sixth of September eighty-three
A: In paragraph two you have reported that you have examined him on the seventh of August nineteen eighty-three and that he was found to have in-co-ordination of the right side of his body
A: Now can you tell the Court more about what in-co-ordination that you found
B: We test for in-co-ordination my Lord in a very standard way
B: We ask a person to touch your finger and touch his nose and move up and down or to do a series of concerted actions like imitating playing the piano or picking up objects
B: And by observing him do this we can notice any problems with movement
A: In your opinion doctor do you know whether such injury would be permanent"
477,"B: And by observing him do this we can notice any problems with movement
A: In your opinion doctor do you know whether such injury would be permanent
A: The in-co-ordination
B: It was present my Lord for more than two years after the accident
B: And I would therefore assume that it would permanent
A: From this injury to his brain doctor would you say that there would be any side effect like for instance loss of memory headaches relapses
B: He could have mental problems but by his own testimony my Lord he did not complain of headaches and said he was otherwise normal"
478,"B: It was present my Lord for more than two years after the accident
B: And I would therefore assume that it would permanent
A: From this injury to his brain doctor would you say that there would be any side effect like for instance loss of memory headaches relapses
B: He could have mental problems but by his own testimony my Lord he did not complain of headaches and said he was otherwise normal

479,"A: I see

B: No I am certain my Lord he was hospitalised
C: For how long
B: I do not have a record of that not available
A: Sir with your leave"
482,"C: I mean was there any in co-ordination in this hand
C: Or what was he suffering from while he was warded
C: Or is it just a brain contusion
B: My Lord I do not recall what my observations were when he was warded because I would have been in charge of a very large number of cases
B: And my own observations for each individual case would not have been made
B: My Lord I would have supervised his treatment rather than be in charge of his day-to-day treatment
C: Doctor your medical report is brief"
483,"C: Or is it just a brain contusion

C: He was not seen by you is that not doctor"
485,"C: He was seen by some other doctor on that date as an outpatient
B: Yes he may not have been seen by me when I
C: So you wouldn't be able to assist this Court as to what his problems of co-ordination were on that date
B: Not on this date no my Lord
C: Now on your third report doctor
C: On your third report you say he was reassessed for the purpose of this report on seventeenth August eighty-three
C: At that time he was found to have in-co-ordination of the right side of his body"
486,"C: Does this report refer to the earlier findings of in- co-ordination rather than on that date
B: It refers to my own assessment of him in August eighty-three

A: Yes my Lord
A: What I want to confirm is the time of death Doctor Wee
A: Where did you get the information from
C: This information was given to us on the police three zero three report"
604,"A: One is the cash surrender value that is a savings element and the other one is the coverage
A: There's always these two concepts you see
A: Now this is the death benefit uh so on the event of death we pay this amount <X>
A: How much You check off against the year here alright Now this is a policy year we run it from one to twenty This is a summary of your age at five-year intervals right Now it will go on until nineteen ninety but I stop at seventy because there's no place for the computer printout So this is what we pay on death [ah] in the event of diagnosis of disease fifty thousand is paid one off and uh on disability we pay over five years the full amount you see Now this is the medical part which is included there already Now this is the interesting part nuh the parent-child option which I was explaining to you I I do not know whether you're planning to start a family soon if I'm not right right Uh let's say you you have a kid now I I just run a hypothetical example alright Let's say you have a kid now uh uh a son you just born of course uh it doesn't mean that you must have a son now you can have a son two years from now you see and then you can register him under this rider which is given free to you if you buy the plan So when your son is eighty one if you transfer the plan to your son we will give you back twenty-six thousand alright Your son's coverage will start at hundred and twenty thousand but he is only paying this premium rate per month per year sorry per year Now this you can see is an extremely cheaf cheap rate of seven hundred and four dollars per year and that is twenty-one years from now Assuming hypothetically that you have a new-born son now but if you have a son two years from now the rate is even cheaper you see because your son is not born yet So the rate is seven o four per year alright and uh this money is given back to you This is his insurance this is his premium Now we can extrapolate uh into the into the future So let's say you have passed to your son at twenty-one when your son is sixty years of age uh if you terminate the plan you will get back he will get back two hundred eighty-five thousand and this coverage will be this amount here This is his coverage when he's sixty years of age We are now projecting into the future but all the time he's only paying this premium which is that of a small baby just born you see If I can just show you by a straight line graph uh you see let's call let's look at this This is premium rate and this is uh age huh So uh are you familiar with statistics Uh now as you get older and older Mrs Lee your premium rate will increase but once you have bought the plan the rate is fixed you see So it depends where you come on board you see alright Now the older you are of course the more expensive it is because we are more susceptible to diseases So assuming now your son when he's twenty-one you pass him the plan by right he should be paying this premium rate here alright of a twenty-one year old but actually what he's paying is this premium rate here of a newborn infant backdated to the year he was born you see that that is the whole concept you see but even if he your son is born healthy uh or your daughter is born healthy there is no guarantee that they will remain healthy until twenty-one you see So even along the way if they develop a medical problem at twenty-one they are guaranteed of this uh of this plan you you know what I'm trying to say Now basically this is the the plan that we have been selling quite a lot of it around here to to the to uh I've some of it in the law faculty you see Uh this is the summary alright this is a summary whereby you stop paying after fourteen years This one you have the option of paying till sixty-five you know after fourteen years you need not stop you can keep on paying till sixty-five then you follow this scenario here Then this is your covering letter and this is a brochure which explains a bit of what I have just told you the parent's option alright where you can pass it to your kid and uh I've also enclosed one plan for your husband in case he may be interested to have a talk </X> </I>"

A: There are some riders
B: Ah

A: If you opt for a pay up at tenth time even is uh twenty years down the road it will still pay you that particular value
A: Ya for example if let's say at the tenth year you opt for pay up which is eleven thousand so another ten years down the road okay you will only they will only eleven thousand if something happen to you"
644,"A: It's just no it's up to thirtieth of November but of course uh don't wait until the last minute because uh it may be some complication who knows
B: You think something like Telecoms rush
A: Ya ya ya you'd be surprised you know
B: No [lah] what Telecoms rush
B: You won't have another Telecoms rush
A: No what I mean of course not
A: But what I'm trying to say is that okay give us two weeks you know because maybe you need a medical check-up you know"
645,"B: You see it's still at the same rate whether I I get the rider or not
A: Ya but presumably let's say if you are medically unfit right now if you have a rider then the company have not right to reject you
A: You get what I'm trying to say
B: Ah ha
A: Alright so the other about this policy is that now if you take it as a rider now this policy or rather the rider will stop paying when you are sixty
A: And the two particular disease which you have Alzheimer and Parkinson and that basically attack a person in their old age
A: And a lot of this problem actually you know uh appears when the person is old and it doesn't make sense you know that you buy this policy to protect you right now but when it come to your old age there's nothing to protect you </I>"

B: So you mean I can like take out some money after 20 years"
658,"B: So what happen to my policy then
A: Your policy still carries on till you either cancel it or till there is a claim made
B: So you mean I can like take out some money after 20 years
A: Yeah you can you can cash it out but I have a better idea
A: You don't cash it out but instead you take a loan carry on with the Giro deduction and you are still under cover by John Hancock
A: You need not pay back till you have the money
A: If anything does happen to you or you wish to surrender it later the amount at that point of time would always be higher than what you borrowed"
659,"A: You just pay for the time to come
A: When he's 21 years old and you can take out the money

B: I think you have known uh if you have read the papers uh over the past few months uh in fact the local banks uh we are actually quite heavy laden with the with non-performing loans
B: So Sad to say but uh because of all these we are actually uh forced in certain ways to re-look into all the credit facilities granted to our customers so I think that is basically my objection my my objective today"
669,"B: I know it is a bit difficult but uh
A: Wa still have to reduce some more
B: Ya have to reduce
B: Ah so I know it is a bit difficult given the uh I mean just now like what you say about times are bad and all that but we really really have to come up you know today to tell you basically these are some of the intention that the bank is adopting
A: But but my business is already so bad and I really have some strict cash flow problem and all my facilities in this factory is being stretched to the maximum already and how can you come to me and tell me that you need to reduce my O D line some more
A: I just don't know lah
A: I really don't know"
670,"B: Ya have to reduce
B: Ah so I know it is a bit difficult given the uh I mean just now like what you say about times are bad and all that but we really really have to come up you know today to tell you basically these are some of the intention that the bank is adopting
A: But but my business is already so bad and I really have some strict cash flow problem and all my facilities in this factory is being stretched to the maximum already and how can you come to me and tell me that you need to reduce my O D line some more
A: I just don't know [lah]
A: I really don't know
B: Uh but actually what we can do is that we we uh we understand your problem but we really hope that Mr Tan you could understand the position we are in lah
B: Although a lot of time people say that you know banks are you know during rainy days uh we will take away the umbrella"
671,"A: But but my business is already so bad and I really have some strict cash flow problem and all my facilities in this factory is being stretched to the maximum already and how can you come to me and tell me that you need to reduce my O D line some more
A: I just don't know lah
A: I really don't know
B: Uh but actually what we can do is that we we uh we understand your problem but we really hope that Mr Tan you could understand the position we are in [lah]
B: Although a lot of time people say that you know banks are you know during rainy days uh we will take away the umbrella
B: But I hope you all can understand that uh we are also quite badly hit ah
B: Property value have all drop and all that"
672,"A: I just don't know lah
A: I really don't know
B: Uh but actually what we can do is that we we uh we understand your problem but we really hope that Mr Tan you could understand the position we are in lah
B: Although a lot of time people say that you know banks are you know during rainy days uh we will take away the umbrella
B: But I hope you all can understand that uh we are also quite badly hit ah
B: Property value have all drop and all that
B: In fact all the all the case in fact ninety percent of our cases uh in our portfolio actually to use the term very crudely we are actually all underwater"
673,"A: I really don't know
B: Uh but actually what we can do is that we we uh we understand your problem but we really hope that Mr Tan you could understand the position we are in lah
B: Although a lot of time people say that you know banks are you know during rainy days uh we will take away the umbrella
B: But I hope you all can understand that uh we are also quite badly hit [ah]
B: Property value have all drop and all that
B: In fact all the all the case in fact ninety percent of our cases uh in our portfolio actually to use the term very crudely we are actually all underwater
B: We are all struggling so we we understand we also understand your O D has been used up to the hilt and then at certain times also you actually went over the limit but uh we are trying to see whether we can do a restructure"
674,"B: Property value have all drop and all that
B: In fact all the all the case in fact ninety percent of our cases uh in our portfolio actually to use the term very crudely we are actually all underwater
B: We are all struggling so we we understand we also understand your O D has been used up to the hilt and then at certain times also you actually went over the limit but uh we are trying to see whether we can do a restructure
B: We are not trying to say we want to bring it back down to two hundred [lah] you know within twenty-four hours
B: We are looking at a maybe a restructured payment say maybe five thousand per month something like that
B: Something that you are comfortable with hor and then at least uh you know we could use this as a tool and then to tie tide over this period of time
B: For all you know five thousand you know a month over over one year we are looking at only sixty thousand"
675,"B: So if that is the case then I would suggest is that uh but coming back to the point again it is five I mean it is like what I said
B: We are not looking at two hundred thousand although this is uh you know the initial idea that head office has imposed on your account but I am looking at a maybe on gradual basis what about five thousand per month
B: Do you think you can manage with that for the time being
B: So every month we reduce by five thousand [lah] so over a period of one year we are looking at sixty thousand because if that is OK then maybe again I cannot promise you this is this is only uh a decision on my end here
B: It may be approved it may not be approved
B: But I want to have I want to work out something that is more comfortable so long as you are comfortable I think that is more important
B: At the end of the day you don't over commit yourself to the bank and then if you are something that you are comfortable you can fulfil I think that is more important"
676,"B: At the end of the day you don't over commit yourself to the bank and then if you are something that you are comfortable you can fulfil I think that is more important
A: Right I understand that
A: Uhm five thousand sounds OK but I may have to like retrench some of my workers
B: Wah in that case sounds quite bad if it is five thousand but I think this is the best that I can do This is the best that I can do so uh anyway we will also take into consideration of the long relationship that you have with us having bank with us for over the last twenty years beginning with your father's time
B: So I ya ya I will also take in consideration of the possibility of you know even if you have to retrench some of your staff if you go on a O D reduction
B: Anyway I will try my very best Mr Tan
B: What I do is that I will write a short report and then we give it to we see whether we can come back to you say within a week's time"
677,"B: Within a week's time and then we see how we go from there
B: If really you have any problem then what we do is that after six months okay we will come back to you again and well we can sit down and then discuss further then
B: I mean let us hope that the economy will recover by then because right now the biggest problem that we have is that we actually uh sitting on a lot of properties like for example these factories that you have now uh last year when I came in it was something like three point five million and then today we are looking at two million so straightaway we are looking at a negative network of about one point five million so this is the biggest headache that we are facing
B: So I think not a problem [lah]
B: Don't worry
B: I mean I will come to you in say one week's time and then we see how we go from there
A: What about your bank"
678,"B: Oh banks we are affected we are affected
B: Uh in fact if you if you read the uh annual reports of all the local banks we are making hefty provision for the industries so we are badly hit
B: We are badly hit
B: So you know we are not spared [lah]
B: Okay we are not spared lah
A: Uhm nice to know that I am not alone in all this
B: You are not spared okay"
679,"B: Uh in fact if you if you read the uh annual reports of all the local banks we are making hefty provision for the industries so we are badly hit
B: We are badly hit
B: So you know we are not spared lah
B: Okay we are not spared [lah]
A: Uhm nice to know that I am not alone in all this
B: You are not spared okay
B: We are all business uh private organisations we are not spared but we have to be prudent huh like living in Singapore we have to be prudent"
680,"A: Uhm nice to know that I am not alone in all this
B: You are not spared okay
B: We are all business uh private organisations we are not spared but we have to be prudent huh like living in Singapore we have to be prudent
B: We have to again uh we have to protect the interest of our share-holders, depositors and all that [lah] but uh well never mind we see how it will it goes
B: More important I think we want to see that we can help our local enterprise here to ride through this bad times which is the reason why I have said we are always open for discussion although the intention is to reduce your OD limit by two hundred thousand but I think we can always look into a restructured payment
B: Five thousand if it is too difficult for you we try it for six months
B: After six months if you really have problems come back to us OK our doors are open anytime"
681,"i: Management meeting </X>
A: Think this is the first time we have two generations in the same meeting
A: Uh we won't wait for uh Sheila so we can get started
A: I think Tan knows why uh he is here to capture the English used not the Chinese used
A: Uhm I must say first I will have to leave by one forty-five so I am going to run through a little bit faster then maybe some of you anything you all want to discuss together as a group
A: Uh first of all the sports can I leave you to look after that after I have left"
682,"A: So we only had two forms last year
A: Uh this year they have asked for the uh potential form to be done in May right
A: The performance form if is if at all is need to be done but they have not decided but if it should to be done it will be done at the end of the year
A: So performance form will come at the end of the year potential will be done at the end of May and the schedule will be out I will give you the detailed schedule at a nearer date but just basically uh to let you know ahead of time so that it won't come as a big shock
A: We need we need to do uh the teachers' ranking together with the remember we had a teachers' ranking session together with the uh inspectors
B: Yes
A: You remember"
683,"C: Will it involve P6 pupils
A: Uh we have checked that
A: We will be remaining open but most of us felt that it should be P5 because P5 pupils June quite close to streaming exam
C: Ah that's right
B: P5 exam
A: So I think the target should be P5 P4 and P6 are out simply because it's too close to the exam
A: So it would be P5 pupils all right"
684,"B: Our present house cost us one hundred and seven-three thousand and we have paid so far about eight-six thousand dollars
B: How much can my house fetch now
B: Is it somewhere three hundred and fifty thousand

1323,"A: But then I was thinking that MOE may not find that very very flattering that you consider it like you know if everything else fails then you fall back on teaching
B: <unclear> word </unclear>
A: When I saw that I saw that that line I said
A: Is this <unclear> word </unclear> okay good [lah] not not too bad
A: That that one line uh
A: If I was MOE and interview
A: Oh I see"
1324,"A: That that one line uh
A: If I was MOE and interview
A: Oh I see
B: Go and tell to MOE [lah]
B: You got no choice okay
A: You want you take
B: Ya"
1325,"A: That means you join the Ministry and dance like inspector for dance kind of thing
A: Then you go around the schools and things

B: Ya <unclear> word </unclear>
A: Takes care of dance as well you see"

1328,"A: <unclear> word </unclear> No that's why what I meant was that uhm if you you want dance to in a sense uh complement what
B: What I do
A: What you do right rather than it being the main thing <unclear> word </unclear>
A: But then you find that uh I don't know [lah]
A: I I've seen a lot of people who've gone into teaching and then find that they can spare time later to do dance or whatever
A: You find that it drains you so much that you will not benefit <unclear> word </unclear>
B: Ya it's true"
1329,"B: But I mean idealistically speaking I just want to get money and and studying dance somewhere
B: That's idealistically and and like not even wanting to come back and work and hold some kind of responsible position I I
A: Great
B: Good [lah]
B: But wish but that's not my primary concern right now I mean like
A: You never you would never consider going say joining say SDT or it's very <unclear> word </unclear> lifestyle
B: If I come out <X>"
1330,"A: With experiments
B: Ya and create something
B: So I don't know whether whether I'll call myself a choreographer first or a dancer first
B: But the thing I wanna call myself I don't know I <unclear> word </unclear> I don't know what you call it [lah]
B: But I I like I find my greatest joy uhm sharing whatever things I have with others <unclear> word </unclear> which is actually teaching </X> </I>"

B: Otherwise is a bit difficult for people like us at the bottom"
1332,"B: Ya
A: So what's your comment about tomorrow's meeting
B: Tomorrow ah
B: Ah tomorrow we're having our staff meeting and I hope Dr Teo can uh let us know our future direction clearer
B: Because uhm I think we're thinking of moving into a lot of new areas but uhm we must have a clear direction and clear commitment from the management
B: Otherwise is a bit difficult for people like us at the bottom
A: So uhm is is the restructuring of the organisation affecting you anyway"
1333,"A: We'll be the frontline
B: Ya
A: For all all the <unclear> word </unclear>
B: I I I'm not so sure exactly how they're going to uh divide the work [lah] but from what I know it's uhm uhm people like Diane myself Shuefen
B: They all will be doing development work and then when users have problem they won't call us directly they will call I don't know who from your side would be but I think you're one of them uhm when the printer got problem they call you
A: You mean you mean normal problem
A: What I'm referring to is those uhm as I said uh the accounting system you know"
1334,"B: They all will be doing development work and then when users have problem they won't call us directly they will call I don't know who from your side would be but I think you're one of them uhm when the printer got problem they call you
A: You mean you mean normal problem
A: What I'm referring to is those uhm as I said uh the accounting system you know
B: Ya so if if there is any of uh any problems that belongs to say say a particular application [ah] they will still go to the frontline people and if those people cannot solve it then they will channel back to the back up people
A: Oh I see
B: So because uh if say right now uh if the user say our user the account user they they printer got problem they will still call us you know
A: Uhm uhm uhm"
1335,"B: Uh the interface uh
A: Solve the the minor minor problems we'll solve
A: But when it comes to a more the more specialised programmes we'll look you'll look into that
B: Ya I think for you guys uh I think you'll still be involved in some development work [lah]
B: But I think most of the time you're attending to user
A: I hope not because it's supposed to be twenty twenty per cent the most
B: Ha"
1336,"B: Ha
A: Am I right
A: And uh I think we'll be also involved development work
B: Ah
A: For me is uh postgrad schools ya and that's already a lot of maintenance actually
B: You expect to get other project
A: Ya ya"
1337,"A: What S Q L D S
B: I thought I thought I thought you have to do some S Q L work
A: Uhm you mean oh assessing to the database is it
B: Ah
A: Of course that is that's where all the records are stored
B: All these while you're working on this system lah
A: Yes yes but of course the system sort of like retrieve and manipulates the data in the database"
1338,"A: Uhm you mean oh assessing to the database is it
B: Ah
A: Of course that is that's where all the records are stored
B: All these while you're working on this system [lah]
A: Yes yes but of course the system sort of like retrieve and manipulates the data in the database
A: By the way uh Weiying is supposed to back me up
B: Who"
1339,"B: Who
A: Weiying from your group
B: Weiyan uh
A: Ah Weiyan ya suppose to
A: She's suppose to uhm back me up
B: In this system uh
A: Ya which is a surprise to me"
1340,"A: It's just like physically uh changing office now
A: Job wise also change
B: Because actually uh you know I'm also working on this exam mark entry system right
B: Actually this one is done by done by a staff quite sometime ago [lah] and then a William took over and now I was ask to look into it further and
A: Further you mean enhancement
B: Ya maybe got to rewrite the whole thing lah
A: Why"
1341,"B: Because actually uh you know I'm also working on this exam mark entry system right
B: Actually this one is done by done by a staff quite sometime ago lah and then a William took over and now I was ask to look into it further and
A: Further you mean enhancement
B: Ya maybe got to rewrite the whole thing [lah]
A: Why
B: Because ah because we're facing a lot of problems
B: We our there are a lot of departments using it and then they're all over the campus"
1342,"A: Further you mean enhancement
B: Ya maybe got to rewrite the whole thing lah
A: Why
B: Because [ah] because we're facing a lot of problems
B: We our there are a lot of departments using it and then they're all over the campus
B: And then one once they call up complain that there's a problem
B: We can't solve it on the spot we have to go down so it takes a lot of our time"
1343,"B: And then one once they call up complain that there's a problem
B: We can't solve it on the spot we have to go down so it takes a lot of our time
B: So we're trying to find out ways to cut down on all this travelling
A: Uhm uhm that means more or less cut down on maintenance [lah]
B: Ya ya especially ya this thing is only used during exam time lah so
A: Once
B: During this period"
1344,"B: We can't solve it on the spot we have to go down so it takes a lot of our time
B: So we're trying to find out ways to cut down on all this travelling
A: Uhm uhm that means more or less cut down on maintenance lah
B: Ya ya especially ya this thing is only used during exam time [lah] so
A: Once
B: During this period
A: Once a year that sort of thing"
1345,"A: Once a year that sort of thing
B: Ya and uh and also for me during this period uh is the the account section
B: They're having their year-end closing so it's a lot of work at us at the same time
B: So this one got to look into it [lah]
B: I'm currently looking into ways to improve and uh cut down on the the travelling
A: Improving uh by adding on or changing the system or to cut completely new you know
A: language or whatever"
1346,"A: Improving uh by adding on or changing the system or to cut completely new you know
A: language or whatever
B: Or I don't know my boss was saying look into client server solution pos
B: That's one possibility [ah] but I don't think uhm this justifies because this
A: It's too expensive
B: Is going to take up too much time
B: I rather you know during uh this period you can do a bit of walking around rather than <unclear> word </unclear>"
1347,"B: Ya <unclear> word </unclear> users than to spend a months to redevelop to whole thing
A: But then if you redevelop it'll be let me think in the long run it'll be beneficial to everyone
B: Yes ya but the thing is when you rewrite probably five years later you've got to revamp the whole thing again
B: So the thing is whether spending this six months is is worth or not for this next five months [ah] sorry five years and during these five years is not you're not using it everyday
B: You're only using it during the exam period
A: But then you must see that uhm how about personally for saying to think that is beneficial to you
A: I mean you'll be learning a lot of new things"
1348,"A: I mean you'll be learning a lot of new things
B: Ya
A: I think you find it quite interesting uhm
B: Ya uh I was telling my boss [lah] to use it as a as a learning platform
B: That's very good because if you were to move into client server next time we need to start off with some simple project uhm
B: We need to start off with some prototypes so that we can iron out
B: We can avoid uhm committing some serious uhm mistakes in uh in the real system you see so this is a a a good application to start off with lah"
1349,"B: Ya uh I was telling my boss lah to use it as a as a learning platform
B: That's very good because if you were to move into client server next time we need to start off with some simple project uhm
B: We need to start off with some prototypes so that we can iron out
B: We can avoid uhm committing some serious uhm mistakes in uh in the real system you see so this is a a a good application to start off with [lah]
B: So uhm but if you were to develop purely for saving time one then I think this is not the right approach ah probably adding or modifying the existing programme is better
B: Ah so so let's talk about more your work
A: My my work uh"
1350,"B: That's very good because if you were to move into client server next time we need to start off with some simple project uhm
B: We need to start off with some prototypes so that we can iron out
B: We can avoid uhm committing some serious uhm mistakes in uh in the real system you see so this is a a a good application to start off with lah
B: So uhm but if you were to develop purely for saving time one then I think this is not the right approach [ah] probably adding or modifying the existing programme is better
B: Ah so so let's talk about more your work
A: My my work uh
A: Uh at the moment I'm I'm doing of maintenance work and looking into development of uh uh some of the subsystem in addition to this assistance system maintenance"
1351,"B: We need to start off with some prototypes so that we can iron out
B: We can avoid uhm committing some serious uhm mistakes in uh in the real system you see so this is a a a good application to start off with lah
B: So uhm but if you were to develop purely for saving time one then I think this is not the right approach ah probably adding or modifying the existing programme is better
B: Ah so so let's talk about more your work
A: My my work uh
A: Uh at the moment I'm I'm doing of maintenance work and looking into development of uh uh some of the subsystem in addition to this assistance system maintenance
A: And uhm it still requires a lot of enhancement"
1352,"A: They change things uh now and then you see with new subjects you see with new subjects and so on coming in
A: So that requires a lot of changes to the system and that keeps me very busy ya
B: And on top of that you still got to support what Word Perfect
A: Uhm those are normal uh user supports [lah] located a a couple faculties to take I mean to take care of all the secretaries and so on for the O A System and general PC problem
B: Actually uh actually is quite interesting and quite good to have exposure to to do some uhm PC work
B: Uh if it is just purely mainframe then it's quite boring at times
A: Uh quite true because mainframe seems that there are much more restrictions than PCs"
1353,"B: Is it
A: I'm supporting it
B: No no no I mean vendor support
A: Oh vendor support hah uh ya
A: I'm not too sure about that
B: Maybe there's no more upgrade anymore or what
B: I'm not so sure"
1354,"B: Maybe there's no more upgrade anymore or what
B: I'm not so sure
A: You mean it's a dead
B: Ya ya but it's working [lah]
B: Future enhancement
B: Probably there isn't any
A: Oh I see so you're looking into vendor <unclear> word </unclear> that is growing"
1355,"B: Uhm no
A: Just
B: Actually even in Personnel also the requirement can be very very high because you're talking about storing uhm uhm all documents you know belonging to each staff belonging to student
B: So when you apply for a job and then your resume your application form everything this probably got to be stored electronically [lah]
B: So by scanning in as an image and uh uh storing on uhm secondary storage devise
A: Like what like what CD-Rom
B: Optical disc"
1356,"B: Optical disc
A: Optical disc
B: Ya it's something called Optical Judebox and that stores many optical disks but then these are very very expensive
B: So currently we are just looking into it [lah]
A: So what's the chances how's the chance like
B: Uh with that like of budget we have I think it's quite difficult to get uh a a very sophisticated system lah
B: We're just looking into the <unclear> word </unclear> feasibility lah and not not the actual product yet"
1357,"B: Ya it's something called Optical Judebox and that stores many optical disks but then these are very very expensive
B: So currently we are just looking into it lah
A: So what's the chances how's the chance like
B: Uh with that like of budget we have I think it's quite difficult to get uh a a very sophisticated system [lah]
B: We're just looking into the <unclear> word </unclear> feasibility lah and not not the actual product yet
B: And also the user side has not identified exactly what should be <unclear> word </unclear> archive into into uh uh computerised system

B: So you know they get the best they want a higher price

B: No even if let's say in <unclear> word </unclear> in later stage uh other countries are willing to pay higher they cannot give my allocated quantity to them in that sense you see
B: But once I've agreed to this price during the budgeting time I'll if my I'm allocated this quantity this quantity will be for me [lah]
B: But of course if I can't sell this quantity then there's another issue lah
B: That means I didn't raise my budget you see
A: Uhm"
2065,"B: That means will be allocated quantities to you at this price then that's it
B: No even if let's say in <unclear> word </unclear> in later stage uh other countries are willing to pay higher they cannot give my allocated quantity to them in that sense you see

A: I'm quite interested about the P S C lah especially on the education service but uh my main thrust is to ask them what is because uhm lately there has been calls for increasing teachers' pay so but the details has has not been made known to public so maybe I I hope they can ya that's right
A: But I don't think they will tell me everything [lah] in details but what I suppose is that they will not exactly touch on the starting pay but more on the increment yearly increment nah because the Civil Service yearly in increment is very little can say is very little
B: Well for my case I won't be interested of any of these simply because I'm already bonded so uhm there's no room for me to look other career until or unless somebody can bail me out of this trap
A: Ah ha but you have to pay uh
B: Ya you got"
2270,"A: I'm quite interested about the P S C lah especially on the education service but uh my main thrust is to ask them what is because uhm lately there has been calls for increasing teachers' pay so but the details has has not been made known to public so maybe I I hope they can ya that's right

A: Ah ha but you have to pay uh
B: Ya you got
A: If you want to break the bond you have to pay
B: Yes I have to pay the whole lump sum"
2271,"A: It's a six year scholarship
B: Yes it's a six six years bond
B: Well if you were to continue teaching I mean if you intend to teach right so we might in the same line because my scholarship is actually teaching
A: Teaching scholarship [lah]
B: Yes
A: Do you know the starting starting pay
B: Well I'm not very sure"
2272,"B: Well I'm not very sure
B: I guess it's about two thousand
A: Two thousand odd
B: For guys because of the N S thing [lah] yes
A: But during the the course at N I E will be about one thousand three right and I mean ya one thousand three hundred
B: Well about it
A: And I've been looking through the past years in terms of this uh grant you know I mean teaching grant or teaching bursary whatever they call it"
2273,"A: Do you think it's enough
B: Well actually uhm maybe not now maybe later when the time comes I guess the problem will be there
B: I really don't because presently you don't need the money so and you I guess you won't feel the difference but unless during that time when you start to be involved in the whole programme and you need the money then you starts to voice out again
B: So normally you just tackle the problem when the problems come [lah]
A: Do you think uh the education service has done uh done their part in terms of retaining the the talented the best in terms of uh teachers
B: Well if you were to look at my case most of my lect tutors in J Cs they have left
B: Ya in fact they are all quite good simply because other places or rather the private sides are paying them more than what the teaching line are doing so I guess one of the method is the pay"
2274,"A: Camp
B: Ya some some are involve in like you know English camps in video camps
B: What have you
A: So to make the career more ex exciting in a sense [lah]
B: Ya
A: But what what do you think of
A: Okay so far the the"
2275,"A: To deal with the
B: To to to deal with this
A: Administrative
B: nNt only administrative matters but maybe the E C As you know like you know like maybe for instance to talk about N P C C maybe can get some of those people who are more involve in N P C C to to to become guidence or counsellor rather than rather than to get the locals </X> </I>"
2276,"A: Actually the the only thing that we have uh I mean the don't know [lah] I mean my school we we we we always thought that the that the headquarters didn't like us
B: Why
A: There is some kind of conception or misconception or some sort lah
B: Really"
2277,"A: Actually the the only thing that we have uh I mean the don't know lah I mean my school we we we we always thought that the that the headquarters didn't like us
B: Why
A: There is some kind of conception or misconception or some sort [lah]
B: Really
A: I mean because we we we won a lot of competitions
B: True"
2278,"B: It's just talking to us I mean
A: Making conversation
A: Okay all right
A: Ya so so ya I mean I they they they they thought that that we won a little too many [lah] so ya but there was well I always thought Red Cross should stand for uh the first aid sign [lah]
A: So actually when when I don't know I uhm when when my my school did better in foot drill I I did question the the rationale
A: Look you know what I mean
A: This you are you're you're supposed surely ought to be better in first aid"
2279,"A: All right
B: Discipline is very important
A: Right
A: I remember I was in charge of a pla platoon and uh they were all juniors of course
A: I was senior at that time you see and uh they actually uh could not do a drill well
A: You know the timing is important and all that so uh there was one particular drill where actually which the they form and the was not up to par and I I I while I make a big hoo ha out of it and then they cried after that
A: It was quite quite uh uh quite dramatic in a sense but I think I was trying to stress to them the importance of it"
2280,"A: So I guess you didn't really like much drills and all that
A: No actually uh for foot drill I did quite well
A: Ya I think I did quite well at foot drill
A: I enjoyed uhm ya the formations and all that [lah]
A: I mean it was like quite fun lah you know but there is a lot of hard work lah and I think that because of because of so much drill actually uhm you know physiologically my legs like grew a lot more than my arms
B: Longer
A: Not not longer but I think the the leg muscles are a lot better develop or my leg muscles are a lot better develop than than muscles elsewhere on my body you see"
2281,"A: No actually uh for foot drill I did quite well
A: Ya I think I did quite well at foot drill
A: I enjoyed uhm ya the formations and all that lah
A: I mean it was like quite fun [lah] you know but there is a lot of hard work [lah] and I think that because of because of so much drill actually uhm you know physiologically my legs like grew a lot more than my arms
B: Longer
A: Not not longer but I think the the leg muscles are a lot better develop or my leg muscles are a lot better develop than than muscles elsewhere on my body you see
A: Ya so my father said that if you don't do push ups you look like a kangaroo"
2282,"A: Ya so my father said that if you don't do push ups you look like a kangaroo
A: Ya anyway I I actually join the Red Cross because uh I I was hoping to to practice uh to go into medical practice
B: Oh I see
A: Ya so it was like you know look you know there there is some kind of connections so why don't I just use it like a trump card [lah] so to speak
A: But actually I mean all my involvement with Red Cross uh wasn't I mean I I I don't think the the universities took it very seriously because you say oh well you know my interest
A: Ya I got Red-cross to to prove four years but apparently the the university isn't very interested because I got some other friends who did a lot better at their A levels which Red Cross took book as well and still didn't make it to in medical school so ya I suppose
B: So why did you go into law"
2283,"B: So why did you go into law
A: Uhm
B: How did you go into law then
A: Uh I thought on the strength of my English language competency [lah]
A: Ya
B: What do you mean by competency
A: No I mean it's like I I think I'm I'm I'm fairly comfortable with the English language so"
2284,"A: No I mean it's like I I think I'm I'm I'm fairly comfortable with the English language so
B: Written and oral
A: Written and oral written oral so uh well I mean if if if if if I am really lousy at the Sciences you know why don't I at least use some asset that I have which is competency in English so you know use it in in in in a field of study which which requires that kind of command
A: Uh uh I mean I I won't consider myself proficient [lah] because there are a lot of words which I still don't use don't know how to use don't know the meaning of so uh ya
B: What's your opinion now of this Singlish
B: Do you think that we should talk the way the other Singaporeans are talking or should we talk the way we have been uh taught and brought up to to to speak like a normal you know rofessional at work
A: Well I think it depends on the uh situation in which you use your language"
2285,"B: Like in my previous job I I still do get the opportunity to do so because of the Chinese-speaking uh population uh the manufacturers
A: You will deal with them uh
B: I deal with them I have to talk with them in their lingo although it is American Multinational
B: Uhm but now now that in the teaching profession very difficult unless I am teaching a Chinese class but I think that is uh a bit too difficult [lah]
A: Ya correct
B: In terms of our language ability to really teach the subject in Mandarin so to speak probably takes a while to really get a hang of it
A: Ya I know I got some"
2286,"B: And they are supposed to be writing in their English medium uh in exams or whatever projects and <unclear> word </unclear>
A: You know but in a sense I do sympathise with them because they say look you know what I mean
A: It's it's not that we want to how should I say it's it's to aid them in their understanding of the concept
A: Expression of course is another way [lah] but what is the concept they have this problem you see so I mean ya I I do agree [lah] that sometimes I wish I could use Chinese or you know but a lot of reservations
B: Ya in case we say the wrong thing
A: Ya I suppose it is like I don't want to be laughed at
B: I mean we want to show the best side of what we are"
2287,"A: Okay [lah]
A: You know Mondays
B: What's wrong Mondays
A: Oh well it's after the weekend and ya and I've there's so much work to do"
2288,"A: You know Mondays
B: What's wrong Mondays
A: Oh well it's after the weekend and ya and I've there's so much work to do
A: I'm doing some word-processing [ah]
B: What is is all about
A: Oh no I'm just typing some you know some work and things like that
A: And then this morning I saw Prof in the corridor and I waved to him and I said good morning Prof you know in my usual cheerful fashion"
2289,"B: Did you speak Cantonese while you were there
A: No I didn't I
A: You spoke English I'm afraid
B: Lei sek kong kong fu wah ker ma ng sek ker bai yen lau ker [lor] wor
A: Ya I I I used my Cantonese and then I tried to direct this driver to this you know this place and uh I mispronounce and then he couldn't understand
B: The Hong Kong people can be very sharp with their tongues
A: Ya I was quite fortunate"
2290,"A: That's right
B: Nothing like your home
B: Home sweet home
A: Ah well yes yes
B: So do you think you would be travelling uh this long vacation which is in October
A: Ya I hope to take vacation because I got a lot of leave to clear
B: You have forty-two days"
2291,"B: Yes
A: My students my Science students are telling me that some of the now I know the teachers that they have are not the excellent teachers you know they they are good in their own field but they they don't know how to to communicate their knowledge to their students
A: And to to be a you know to be a good researcher for example it's quite different from being a good teacher
B: And most of them they say are boring in the sense that they only know how to explain how to get the solution or the answer on the blackboard and nothing else because it they they won't bother to crack a joke with you or say anything more besides how to get the answer or a formula
A: Ya and I think and the the technique the pedagogy you know the the teaching technique is quite weak
A: They are they're over using transparencies the overhead projector and they're making love to the transparencies
A: You know they really look you know they don't there's no eye contact with the students no question or answer time and it's you know it's a some of them mumble to themselves and are really bad"
2292,"A: And then and then I so so I got involved in registration copyright you know some documentation and all that and when I applied to this firm I came in hoping to develop my I P practice
A: So basically that was how it went
B: Right so uhm you went from this small firm to David Chong where you also did I P work and
A: Yah yah
A: But now we're here and we both of us have to try and develop the I P practice with our practice head coordinator
B: Yes certainly we should try
A: We shall do our best"
2293,"A: And yourself Vasantha
B: What would you like to know
B: My years at Smith Kline
A: Ah
A: Ya
A: That will be interesting
B: Okay"
2294,"B: You got pharmacist who are actually in pharmacy practice in manufacturing in hospitals in retail and uhm within the pharmaceutical industry
B: Those within that pharmaceutical industry tend to be far more business oriented
A: And marketing
B: and uh yah business and marketing oriented
A: Because they're basically businessmen
A: I suppose it's a more fluid degree to have than something like Law
B: It tends to be quite fluid but uh it it yah I would suppose and you can also you've got the scientific training you see so that does I I feel it makes a difference because it it sharpens your mind in"
2295,"B: and uh yah business and marketing oriented
A: Because they're basically businessmen
A: I suppose it's a more fluid degree to have than something like Law
B: It tends to be quite fluid but uh it it yah I would suppose and you can also you've got the scientific training you see so that does I I feel it makes a difference because it it sharpens your mind in
A: Analytical skills
A: Do you do you think it it it sharpens your skills more than let's say legal training has
B: Uh definitely because it's my my scientific training that has helped me to develop my legal skills"
2296,"A: Because I felt that with all due respect to Arts graduates I felt that when I was when I was still an Arts student uhm are you finding all this very interesting
A: When I was an Arts student I dealt with abstracts you know like like when you do a practical criticism of a article and all that and that has helped
A: Even now let's say when I view a a a movie you can actually look and see what the nuances are and I enjoyed doing that
B: But you see Cecilia the yah yah
A: But le I mean legal training is very different you know and I think my strong Arts uhm bent affected my ability to switch
A: You know what I mean
A: Because you were in Science all along even in school and if there is a marked difference"
2297,"A: But le I mean legal training is very different you know and I think my strong Arts uhm bent affected my ability to switch
A: You know what I mean
A: Because you were in Science all along even in school and if there is a marked difference
B: Yah uhm although I find that the the legal skills that are required for reasoning and analytical work are very akin to Science except that the Science is
A: Is more precious
B: Far more exacting
B: So however analytical you could get with your legal skills and your legal practice you will still never reach the stage that you would truth scientific of truth scientific uhm work"
2298,"A: Is more precious
B: Far more exacting
B: So however analytical you could get with your legal skills and your legal practice you will still never reach the stage that you would truth scientific of truth scientific uhm work
A: Yah you see at the end of the day an an chemistry equation is a chemistry equation
B: It's very that's right and it is very exact
B: It is exact down to the last atom for it to be able to function whereas there's always some amount of leeway in in
A: No in in legal practice it can never be exact because you're dealing with changes circumstances and changing times"
2299,"B: It's very that's right and it is very exact
B: It is exact down to the last atom for it to be able to function whereas there's always some amount of leeway in in
A: No in in legal practice it can never be exact because you're dealing with changes circumstances and changing times
B: Yah yah so I mean no it's not a question of good or bad it's a question of the difference
A: It's a question of the focus yah and it has to be
A: How much more time do we have Chris
A: Nine minutes"
2300,"B: It is exact down to the last atom for it to be able to function whereas there's always some amount of leeway in in
A: No in in legal practice it can never be exact because you're dealing with changes circumstances and changing times
B: Yah yah so I mean no it's not a question of good or bad it's a question of the difference
A: It's a question of the focus yah and it has to be
A: How much more time do we have Chris
A: Nine minutes
A: Hey we didn't do too badly yah so what what else do we need to talk about"
2301,"A: It's a question of the focus yah and it has to be
A: How much more time do we have Chris
A: Nine minutes
A: Hey we didn't do too badly yah so what what else do we need to talk about
A: Oh you say you haven't been to Sri Lanka that would be interesting because I as you know I've married a man who's a Singhalese and uhm he is uh I think sec perhaps a third generation Singaporean and uhm I I I think that Asians nowadays have this dichotomy between them
A: You know about Asian identity being which is very tied to their ethnic and racial identity as opposed to national identity and suppose to their influences cultural influences which we have
A: I mean we're a product of uhm colonial times where uhm the language we speak is actually a language foreign to this region"
2302,"A: Dhotis perhaps it's called dotees
A: So so do they're saying that wearing pants and wearing skirts and blouses is a Western con
B: Reinforces the Western influence
A: Yah yah but does it
A: Because if you if you look at it if you look at even England or or Europe and all that not everybody dress in jeans and shirts
B: Well I think you have a good point there
B: You see the question about all this has got to do with whether which stage the development of the country is at and to what degree the government and the people and the influences of that country choose to view culture and and uhm harmony and identity as a priority"
2303,"B: I think in this current economic climate uh a lot of governments make the conscious decision that economic factors especially in these times of recession are far more important
B: When there's not enough accordance given to cultural aspects then what tends to happen is that well people muddle along
B: They find their own way and the economic policies override
B: And when the economic policies override your Western influences come in because you got your your your your yah
A: Your media
A: Your investments
B: You got your the countries from which you're gonna be able to uh get the trade and give you know import export"
2304,"A: The Westerns
A: You know during the colonial times it was Europe
A: It was England you know the great British empire and then in the later part of this century aft especially after World War Two it was America
B: Yah
A: Right so where where where economic strength lies political strength lies with it exert a lot of cultural influence as well
A: You know what I mean
A: Like for instance uhm take five hundred years ago they talk about Indianisation of this region"
2305,"A: Because comes comes economic power then political power
B: I agree with you
B: I mean I I think essentially that's that's we've agreed on that because it's not that uh the government decides that the cultural if the cultural aspects are going in the opposite direction to the economic aspects
B: I think the economic aspects will overtake yah
A: And then now we have and then and then of course there was China
A: So if you look at let's say a country like Thailand and Indonesia I mean they're actually quite diverse but at at the same time if you look at the way their script is done the way their dances are and also like their religion and all that it's very much influenced by the philosophies of India
A: Then again you to the other extreme"
2306,"A: So if you look at let's say a country like Thailand and Indonesia I mean they're actually quite diverse but at at the same time if you look at the way their script is done the way their dances are and also like their religion and all that it's very much influenced by the philosophies of India
A: Then again you to the other extreme
B: Well our our pinico is based on the Indian pinico <X>
A: Yah but that is I'm talking about over the centuries okay Now I think India's influence because right now India is not as influential as when she was lets say two three hundred years ago
B: Yes yes
A: Before the British came and milked it
B: That's right"
2307,"A: Oh and then and besides that I plan training courses for the staff as well
B: What sort of training courses do you are you talking about
A: Oh things like more of computer related [lah]
A: Things like Word Perfect uhm Lotus
B: You know how
A: I don't think you are that familiar with it"
2308,"B: Oh and uh where do you usually have lunch
B: Is it very crowded
A: Uhm we usually buy back and we watch videos
A: Yah like the latest one we just finished watching Jurassic Park
B: On a video
A: On a video yes
B: Would wouldn't that take away a lot of the fun"
2309,"A: Yes
B: Oh I basically I've been just watching watching movies and going shopping and uh
A: Bought a lot of things
B: Yah I bought a lot of things
A: <unclear> word </unclear>
B: So uh I've seen In the line of Fire
A: Aye tell me what is it"
2310,"B: This okay is like you know Clint Eastwood right
B: So it's about this guy who is a retired no he's not retired he's a he's a very old F B I agent so
A: Is he still working now or
B: He's working but the first time uhm he was suppose to protect uh J F K when he was shot you see and somehow when when he heard the shot right he couldn't react in time you see
B: So this time ha there's a there's this uhm this this man who wants to assassinate the president you know and he calls this Clint Eastwood up you see and carries on this cat and mouse
A: Chase
B: Chase"
2311,"A: Chase
B: Chase
B: Speak to him over the phone
B: At the time he would leave some clues so it's that he will bring the police quite nearly and at the end he will always keep one step ahead
B: So the whole story is about how uhm I mean yah lah the typical
A: So how he finally he solve the case
B: But the thing thing about the show is there's are a lot of uhm characterisation so"
2312,"B: Chase
B: Speak to him over the phone
B: At the time he would leave some clues so it's that he will bring the police quite nearly and at the end he will always keep one step ahead
B: So the whole story is about how uhm I mean yah [lah] the typical
A: So how he finally he solve the case
B: But the thing thing about the show is there's are a lot of uhm characterisation so
A: Like"
2313,"A: So how he finally he solve the case
B: But the thing thing about the show is there's are a lot of uhm characterisation so
A: Like
B: In terms of the characters [lah]
B: You feel like very real you know
B: It's not like some Rambo style or Fugitive
B: You have this super super edition man running around and all this getting ahead of their you know"
2314,"B: In terms of the characters lah
B: You feel like very real you know
B: It's not like some Rambo style or Fugitive
B: You have this super super edition man running around and all this getting ahead of their you know
A: So it's like more realistic than
B: Yah this is more realistic and the people are more real you see
B: They've more depth to the character and uh yah"
2315,"B: It's not like some Rambo style or Fugitive
B: You have this super super edition man running around and all this getting ahead of their you know
A: So it's like more realistic than
B: Yah this is more realistic and the people are more real you see

A: Okay
B: Okay the other show I saw was Dave"
2316,"B: You have this super super edition man running around and all this getting ahead of their you know

A: Yes yah yah
B: So the story goes lah
B: Both of the both of the films sort of like make it sort of like symbolises the American's disillusionment with the government

2318,"A: Okay
B: So what happen is the the the Chief-Of-Staff right keep the impostor in as he would control him you know
A: Yes yah yah
B: So the story goes [lah]
B: Both of the both of the films sort of like make it sort of like symbolises the American's disillusionment with the government

2319,"A: Ya how come didn't go and top up
B: Is it
A: Yes
B: Oh must top up [meh]
B: But I was thinking you put one thousand over dollars into the C P F just to put put it there I think it's quite silly right

A: You are so free now you might as well spend sometime queuing up
B: And I wouldn't sound self-righteous especially after today's uh"
2321,"B: Whether it's by whether it's by Pastor David or
A: Like which which author
B: Whatever Danny
A: Yah yah true

A: Danny
B: Right"
2322,"A: Okay
B: You can you can also order things like the steak which cost almost thirty-seven dollars a meal

2338,"B: Okay I think uh I think maybe what do you think

B: What people think still happy <unclear> word </unclear>
A: They happy"
2340,"B: And uh club membership
A: Yes

A: Yah I mean because these things are like uhm
B: What people think still happy <unclear> word </unclear>
A: They happy
A: Not really because they find that it's an achievement"
2341,"A: They happy
A: Not really because they find that it's an achievement
B: Why is it that people wants to uhm buy expensive things
B: Or you know [lah] maybe
A: Okay you usually they buy
B: Or maybe have you ever felt that that the great sensation when you walked into the shop and you just pick something up without having to make sure you run through the whole town and look for the cheapest deal
A: So far I have I do not have that courage to do yet"
2342,"A: And motivating the the people who are listening to her and and uhm which is going against what she was preaching because she was actually supposed to
B: Motivate instead she ya
A: Motivate the students and failed I mean to talk about uhm sinking you see
A: So that's what the comments were [lah]
A: So what what did your lecturer say
B: In in fact uhm she didn't comment on the video
A: Then she went on straight on"
2343,"A: There was an activity
B: There there there was
A: No no lecture
B: Uhm we we have the activity [lah] yah because we have to so much time anyway only about half an hour
A: You know why because our lecturer was saying that uhm he said most of the time uh the local Singaporean uh students they are always uh remember she said in one of her lecture she said they are impress by those those lect those lecturers who uh who can entertain them
B: Entertain
A: And over and above you know the the content of his lectures so she says this is this one of the reasons uh why because uh she said you you can rest assured that this is one of the uh this these these are the kind of lectures that you can expect if you go overseas uh lectures and they do not take so much you know not like Singapore lecturers"
2344,"B: We you have to listen to the content content to really pick up the interesting thing
B: I mean you can't uh really uhm focus on the visuals to depend on the videos to stimulate you
B: Although that that that played a big part in in motivating you to listen but I think for us we have to be trained <unclear> word </unclear> motivated in no matter where how it's presented as long as the content is good
A: Yah exactly
A: I I mean there's that's way I I felt that the person who brought this issue out was rather childish
A: I would say to think to I mean to think that we need to be entertained in order to have uh lecture properly conducted that sort of thing because I felt that the content was what matters and it was really uhm uhm something that you know is she made use of materials that were easily obtainable daily life and newspapers and all that and I don't think you need to really entertain
A: Of course that will help but I think what what it boils to is uh yourself lah because we're talking about high-level students here"
2345,"A: Yah exactly
A: I I mean there's that's way I I felt that the person who brought this issue out was rather childish
A: I would say to think to I mean to think that we need to be entertained in order to have uh lecture properly conducted that sort of thing because I felt that the content was what matters and it was really uhm uhm something that you know is she made use of materials that were easily obtainable daily life and newspapers and all that and I don't think you need to really entertain
A: Of course that will help but I think what what it boils to is uh yourself [lah] because we're talking about high-level students here
A: We're not talking about uhm lower level students uh I mean
B: We're suppose to be high-level thinkers yah
A: Yah they should think beyond just entertainment value and all that because I thought that that I was actually rather disappointed that they stopped the film halfway because I was just you know she was just getting into the uhm crucial part of it which is uhm you know ideas for activities"
2346,"A: I would say to think to I mean to think that we need to be entertained in order to have uh lecture properly conducted that sort of thing because I felt that the content was what matters and it was really uhm uhm something that you know is she made use of materials that were easily obtainable daily life and newspapers and all that and I don't think you need to really entertain

A: Yah they should think beyond just entertainment value and all that because I thought that that I was actually rather disappointed that they stopped the film halfway because I was just you know she was just getting into the uhm crucial part of it which is uhm you know ideas for activities
A: And I think we need to know about uhm what what what are the different views different ideas they have
A: Because I think if we are to just limit ourselves to what we can uh amongst you know the Asian context and all that then we are not we're being very closed to new ideas"
2347,"A: Of course that will help but I think what what it boils to is uh yourself lah because we're talking about high-level students here
A: We're not talking about uhm lower level students uh I mean
B: We're suppose to be high-level thinkers yah

A: Because I think if we are to just limit ourselves to what we can uh amongst you know the Asian context and all that then we are not we're being very closed to new ideas
A: We shouldn't think about it that way"
2348,"A: So it's rather strange that that person should bring it up and say now and then that it's so boring
A: But I think a lot of the students were not really paying attention to the content uh
B: And how does how did uh Agnes Chang react to that
A: Oh yah that's what that's what she said
A: She said there are sadly to say a lot of the local students think that uhm entertainment comes before content you know uh and unfortunately she says a lot the local lecturers uhm content wise is very strong uh entertaining wise is not as strong so we have to look beyond that especially you know if you see yourself as a high-level students
A: I would think that uh I mean it is so shallow to say that entertainment value comes before content
A: I mean it would be fine"
2349,"A: That's why you are doing all the entertaining all the time
A: Uhm and compare this lecturer with another lecturer who's really boring but he's giving you a lot of uh content material in terms of the topic so she <unclear> word </unclear> anything
B: So the probably the student is not exercising her critical thinking anymore because if she's looking for that alone and and not on the content what is there to be what is there to develop in terms of the critical thinking part
A: Yah because I think perhaps maybe one one one of the thing is the venue in which they have uhm telecast
A: I mean they have uh tape video on because the screen is rather tiny and and
B: And those uh thing projected on the wall
A: O H P"
2350,"A: Cannot be seen
A: I I do not know whether that is whether I mean but I think one thing also they should have probably uhm give us a more focussed directed us to a more focussed what why why they're showing this video to us and at least give us some leeway <unclear> word </unclear>
B: Things to look out for
A: Yah to look out for exactly because I mean it's this this video screening was like a lecture instead of a lecture with a live person
A: It's lecture over the video
A: But uh here we are in this small screen trying very hard to look at the the notes on the screen uhm so that maybe <unclear> word </unclear> probably they get a bit discouraged from that
A: But I think uh the summary was good the summary she gave yah she gave one of the I mean one of the lecturers giving uh one of the summary at the end"
2351,"A: Yah to look out for exactly because I mean it's this this video screening was like a lecture instead of a lecture with a live person
A: It's lecture over the video
A: But uh here we are in this small screen trying very hard to look at the the notes on the screen uhm so that maybe <unclear> word </unclear> probably they get a bit discouraged from that
A: But I think uh the summary was good the summary she gave yah she gave one of the I mean one of the lecturers giving uh one of the summary at the end
A: I mean at least it helps us
A: Yah this is actually what we were we were looking at but uhm it was like a bit too late if you missed it
B: But it's quite but I felt the summary is a bit brief in a sense that I thought she I thought she taught <unclear> word </unclear> more than what she has summarised"
2352,"A: But uh here we are in this small screen trying very hard to look at the the notes on the screen uhm so that maybe <unclear> word </unclear> probably they get a bit discouraged from that

B: But it's quite but I felt the summary is a bit brief in a sense that I thought she I thought she taught <unclear> word </unclear> more than what she has summarised
A: Oh of course she did
A: I mean like there was one section on uhm what you call meaning-centred uh motivate meaning-centred programme or approach uhm which she hardly ever touched which she <unclear> word </unclear> hardly ever touched on it"
2353,"A: Ya I think her summary
B: It's just to confirm what we have summarised
A: Yes more yes that's right
A: It's used to confirm and like we have listened yah what we have written down
A: I think her summary was written there and then
B: Yes I think so like I saw her doing something just now
A: Right"
2354,"B: Yes I think so like I saw her doing something just now
A: Right
A: She was she was scribbling on
A: Yah so I don't know but so what what what did your lecturer do after the screening
B: Oh we have a very interesting discussion about left-handers and right-hander
B: Yah and it sort of confirm that I'm really a left-hander
A: Why"
2355,"A: She was she was scribbling on
A: Yah so I don't know but so what what what did your lecturer do after the screening
B: Oh we have a very interesting discussion about left-handers and right-hander
B: Yah and it sort of confirm that I'm really a left-hander
A: Why
B: Because because she was uh stressing on the part that uhm that the left-hander they they are more creative although I I don't think I'm that creative but uh some aspect of how I how I exercise my thinking seems to fall in with what she said
A: And what is that"
2356,"B: Uhm and also when I look at things I think I I adopt I adopt a more a holistic view than you know uh than analytical view on things
A: Oh what do you mean
A: You mean you look at whole things rather than in parts
B: Things on a whole yah than its part
B: So I guess I'm more I'm better in synthesising things than analysing so when come to analysing problem I'm quite poor I think
B: But when it come to synthesising a lot of things that I've learnt I think I better at it
B: That's why I I really like uhm Doctor Tan Tai Wei's because he's very philosophical and people who are philosophical actually look at things on a whole"
2357,"B: So I guess I'm more I'm better in synthesising things than analysing so when come to analysing problem I'm quite poor I think
B: But when it come to synthesising a lot of things that I've learnt I think I better at it
B: That's why I I really like uhm Doctor Tan Tai Wei's because he's very philosophical and people who are philosophical actually look at things on a whole
A: Whole yah more holistic
B: Yah so
A: Did you oh you didn't read an article
A: There there was this uhm actually article that was uh given to us in mathematical mathematical class and uhm based on what you call why are students not using the visual uhm uh using visual uh diagrams to help them in solving in problem-solving"
2358,"B: But when it come to synthesising a lot of things that I've learnt I think I better at it
B: That's why I I really like uhm Doctor Tan Tai Wei's because he's very philosophical and people who are philosophical actually look at things on a whole

A: There there was this uhm actually article that was uh given to us in mathematical mathematical class and uhm based on what you call why are students not using the visual uhm uh using visual uh diagrams to help them in solving in problem-solving
A: And uhm basically uh what they are trying to say is that uh you know because diagrammatically wise it's probably easy"
2359,"A: I really enjoy her tutorials so much you know and together with Pee Za we had so much fun then uhm and Siang Ling also
A: We used to be uhm actually I I we knew her style is uhm you know she actually wanted to separate us you see
A: So we tried to stick together
B: Oh yah I guess it's more comfortable with people you know but I I like the classes because she tries to give an example of what she wants us to be when actually teaching
B: Not like the others because I find some of them do uhm fail to practise what they preach
B: Ah well with all due respect to them
B: But somehow I wish those those lecturers in N U S went through this course"
2360,"A: So we tried to stick together
B: Oh yah I guess it's more comfortable with people you know but I I like the classes because she tries to give an example of what she wants us to be when actually teaching
B: Not like the others because I find some of them do uhm fail to practise what they preach
B: Ah well with all due respect to them
B: But somehow I wish those those lecturers in N U S went through this course
A: Ah yes
B: Because I I think there're a lot of mechanics they ought to know right how to uhm manage the O H T uhm a lot of other classroom mechanics which I thought would be helpful to them because now I'm looking back I felt find a lot of lecturers and tutors don't really know how to control a class and how to read the faces of pupils of of the students in in university"
2361,"B: Oh yah I guess it's more comfortable with people you know but I I like the classes because she tries to give an example of what she wants us to be when actually teaching

B: Because sometimes I just don't understand a lesson and I find uhm I'm really communicating with the tutor"
2362,"B: Not like the others because I find some of them do uhm fail to practise what they preach

2363,"B: Because I I think there're a lot of mechanics they ought to know right how to uhm manage the O H T uhm a lot of other classroom mechanics which I thought would be helpful to them because now I'm looking back I felt find a lot of lecturers and tutors don't really know how to control a class and how to read the faces of pupils of of the students in in university
B: Because sometimes I just don't understand a lesson and I find uhm I'm really communicating with the tutor
B: You know he's supposed to make sure I understand my work
A: Oh yah
B: So I find uhm N U S tutors senior tutors and lecturers should undergo some form of training to prepare them to impart their knowledge but not just go straight into it after their qualifications or whatever
A: Oh yes I think now they might have this course going on because that day I I was in the library N I E library
A: Then I saw this publication you know that says uh they have actually trained uh uh trained a batch of N U S lecturers and the poly the poly one polytechnic lecturers to undergo this course"
2364,"B: And to go back and then and share what they've learnt
A: Uh well it's course on uhm teaching them uhm you know teaching techniques or lecturing techniques
B: I see I see oh I'm worried about that
A: Yah it's a kind of a small group uh
A: I think probably only those new newer ones will get to try
A: Probably the more senior ones maybe they
B: Yah it won't be very nice to get them <unclear> word </unclear>"
2365,"A: Yah it's a kind of a small group uh
A: I think probably only those new newer ones will get to try
A: Probably the more senior ones maybe they
B: Yah it won't be very nice to get them <unclear> word </unclear>
A: So I think they're having it currently
A: But you you'd be surprise
B: But I still don't think that's enough"
2366,"A: But you you'd be surprise
B: But I still don't think that's enough
B: I I find everybody has to go through it not just uhm a selected few
A: Oh yah I think so too
B: Well anyway
A: Probably they will would have spared us all the lessons you know always of uh trying to find out what they're uh saying
B: Yah anyhow but I'm enjoying this course so far lah"
2367,"A: Oh yah I think so too
B: Well anyway
A: Probably they will would have spared us all the lessons you know always of uh trying to find out what they're uh saying
B: Yah anyhow but I'm enjoying this course so far [lah]
B: How about yourself
A: Yah I'm enjoying myself but then
B: Not that not that I'm learning a lot"
2368,"A: Probably they will would have spared us all the lessons you know always of uh trying to find out what they're uh saying
B: Yah anyhow but I'm enjoying this course so far lah
B: How about yourself
A: Yah I'm enjoying myself but then
B: Not that not that I'm learning a lot
B: It's like sometimes I I just sit through it for the sake of sitting through it but on ocassionally I think about a quarter out of all times I do find I learn something new
A: Yes yes yes"
2369,"A: Say for instance uhm maybe in fact for myself I'm interested in transactional analysis so I really hope that I mean with the our kind of curriculum we have uh is so heavy I I I just have to devote more time to doing my actual school work rather than reading all this kind of things
A: I mean things that really interest me you see like aspects of psychology in this area transactional analysis that actually
B: And then again if everybody does that there won't be uhm enough time to tell you what you have to know
A: Yah but I think actually frankly speaking it's very uhm interesting you know
A: It's really good for teaching I mean besides uh pedagogical wise and learning classroom management everything
A: I mean all all these we're like learning now I think having a really good knowledge uh the psychologically makeup of people is very important
A: That's what I think"
2370,"B: No I didn't pick that because I don't know I I guess I like semi-factual things than rather than uhm actual actually dealing with people
B: Because I'm I my own strength is not very much in dealing with people
B: Don't ask me why I'm teaching
B: But yah when I took the rizac <unclear> word </unclear> test uhm when we're talking about career development I I'm social skill is not of my forte
B: It wasn't wasn't any things that I was good in
B: Yah so and when teacher ask us to share you know our our conclusion of of analysis of ourselves I was quite feeling quite sheepish about it because I didn't have you know social that that letter S
A: I had artistic and then the other was uhm investigative and I can't I think enterprising"
2371,"B: Don't ask me why I'm teaching
B: But yah when I took the rizac <unclear> word </unclear> test uhm when we're talking about career development I I'm social skill is not of my forte

B: Yah so and when teacher ask us to share you know our our conclusion of of analysis of ourselves I was quite feeling quite sheepish about it because I didn't have you know social that that letter S
A: I had artistic and then the other was uhm investigative and I can't I think enterprising
B: Oh oh oh
A: And that was it"
2372,"A: And that was it
A: But it takes all sorts of people to make the world
A: It doesn't mean uh
B: Yah right
B: That's why I that how I I saw it
A: Yah
B: And sometimes you may not know yourself as well as other people know you"
2373,"A: It doesn't mean uh
B: Yah right
B: That's why I that how I I saw it
A: Yah
B: And sometimes you may not know yourself as well as other people know you
B: Like I I keep telling my husband I'm not good with people
B: You're better"
2374,"A: Maybe just that I don't see it myself
B: Calm uh very calm cool uh kind of mannerisms and I think it's good in that sense
A: I don't think it being a teacher means uhm you really have to be very social and outgoing
B: Yah like say we have a keep a distance also so I I think maybe uh this coldness or what you call it will help me
B: Because I I do find some of my friends becoming very close friends with their students and I don't know if that's very healthy
A: Yah
B: Well I I find myself quite comfortable teaching especially like when I'm interacting with the people"
2375,"A: I don't think it being a teacher means uhm you really have to be very social and outgoing
B: Yah like say we have a keep a distance also so I I think maybe uh this coldness or what you call it will help me
B: Because I I do find some of my friends becoming very close friends with their students and I don't know if that's very healthy
A: Yah
B: Well I I find myself quite comfortable teaching especially like when I'm interacting with the people
B: I'm giving tuition and so sometimes I I feel like I'm not sharing enough like I'm not uhm communicative enough interacting enough with them to build a good rapport
B: Then again when I look back uhm I'm doing my job in helping them improve their language skill so uhm what what more do I want you see and they can relate with relate relate to me very well"
2376,"B: Then again when I look back uhm I'm doing my job in helping them improve their language skill so uhm what what more do I want you see and they can relate with relate relate to me very well
B: They feel comfortable with me
B: So I think I mean and that's quite an achievement so you know those
A: Yah don't discourage yourself
B: True
A: But but I still think uhm whether one has uhm an S or not in that rizac uh test
A: It's still very important and crucial to a know uhm the psychological makeup"
2377,"A: Each pupil uhm because uhm in fact even I check with my friends of mine doing <unclear> word </unclear> problems uh they actually don't do much of uhm really psycho analysising each pupil you see
A: I mean not really analysing a pupil's problems uhm all that things you see or I mean even in P C C G also we don't have ready we don't really have a counselling kind of setup you know
A: But we have already learnt counselling and things like that
A: It's just like we maybe because yah
B: Lecturers uh gives information pupil respond teacher gives feedback
A: Yah it's like we just sat there and watched the video right
A: Were you watching the video and then we went back and just analyse the you know the conversation"
2378,"A: But we have already learnt counselling and things like that
A: It's just like we maybe because yah
B: Lecturers uh gives information pupil respond teacher gives feedback
A: Yah it's like we just sat there and watched the video right
A: Were you watching the video and then we went back and just analyse the you know the conversation
B: Yah I think it was time constraining
A: Yah but I find that maybe they should actually enlarge this area because it's I mean"
2379,"B: Lecturers uh gives information pupil respond teacher gives feedback
A: Yah it's like we just sat there and watched the video right
A: Were you watching the video and then we went back and just analyse the you know the conversation
B: Yah I think it was time constraining
A: Yah but I find that maybe they should actually enlarge this area because it's I mean
B: Give us a real mock up
A: Yes"
2380,"A: Yah it's like we just sat there and watched the video right
A: Were you watching the video and then we went back and just analyse the you know the conversation
B: Yah I think it was time constraining
A: Yah but I find that maybe they should actually enlarge this area because it's I mean
B: Give us a real mock up
A: Yes
B: Of counselling session or an actual class dealing with pastor pastoral care"
2381,"B: Of counselling session or an actual class dealing with pastor pastoral care
A: Because otherwise then we'll be just like uh uhm I mean we we are just dealing with symptoms and not the problems you know
A: They they will always these pupils will always come back and the same problems and the same problems again right make them really frustrated you see
B: Yah but I think pastoral care is something uhm you can't really learn as much as you can learn uhm classroom management because it has to do a lot with your own values and how you approach problems yourself because it's basically sharing yourself you know being a second parent to a child
B: That was what I told the teacher but I guess she didn't find that uhm fitting comfortably in her lesson plan so she kind of dismissed it
