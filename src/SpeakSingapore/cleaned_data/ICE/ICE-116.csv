A,Folks say Hi to Brenda
B,Hi
A,Brenda is from NUS and doing Linguistics right
C,Ya
A,Ya and she's working on a project and so wants to record the uh lesson that I'm going to be giving today
D,Is she observing us or you
A,Uh no she's really not observing so much as just recording and then going back to analyse it right
A,Okay
A,Now what we're going to do today is a exercise in multi-track recording okay and specifically you'll be trying to record this commercial
A,Okay I don't have enough copies
A,Four of you'll have to share
A,Wait Mike
A,Sorry I think you better join the other group 'cos I need two guys in a group
A,Okay pretty tacky commercial right
A,Okay nonetheless we'll this is what we're going to try to do
A,Now this is not an assignment in writing a good commercial or producing a commercial
A,It's an exercise in multi-track production okay and for the purposes of actually putting together some program we're going to put together a commercial okay
A,And the commercial is written with too many things in mind
A,Uh it's a wrong way to write it okay
A,I wanted to have music
A,I wanted to have sound effects of a crowd and a few other things and I wanted to make sure that most of them were girls because we we didn't have enough guys in the class
A,Okay that's not the way to write a commercial
A,Okay you normally identify objectives and write it from there instead of the other way around
A,So this is what we'll be doing uh doing it through multi-track recording okay
A,Now the way that you're familiar with up to now is you combine two elements okay two audio sources on the console you record it onto a tape and then if you need to combine even more you use that tape as a source and combine a new element and then if you need to combine more you take that one and combine another one okay
A,It could work that's a valid way of doing things
A,The problem is if you handed in the tape to me at the very end and I said okay I think this's a good commercial right but I wish the music was louder over here or softer over here there's not much you can do because they've all already been combined
A,You understand what I'm saying
A,Okay
A,With the multi-track method what we'll actually do is we will record each element separately on a different track okay and we'll record each one at peak that means you're not uh fading or doing any any of that stuff yet
A,We'll just going to record all of them at peak and then we'll sit down later on after all the elements have been recorded and we'll do the final mix
A,That's when we all sit down and set all the levels and we we record it onto a two-track tape and then we listen to it and say well okay I think at this point the music needs to be louder or softer
A,At this point the conversation is drowned by uh sorry the dialogue is drowned by the conversation at the background so we need to do something
A,Then you can just do it again and make those adjustments
A,Okay so multi-track uh recordings are more flexible in in that way okay
A,Now all tapes that go for broadcast all final master tapes will be on two tracks okay so you will not actually submit that the multi-track recording uhm as a final program
A,Okay that multi-track recording must be mixed down onto a two-track tape okay
A,Uhm tell Emily that she should be <unclear> word </unclear> in the other room
A,Uh
A,Ah with Mike
A,Okay what I want you to do is take a look at the script and try to identify the elements that they have okay
A,And wait first we have sound effects right
A,Uh which one
A,Okay the uh we take it at a time
A,Conversation
A,Okay anything else
A,What else
A,Okay with more sound effects okay
A,The the can popping okay etceteras
A,Now strictly speaking the can popping and the drink being poured into a glass would be separate sound effects that you would have to combine in making the commercial
A,But to simplify matters I've already combined them for you so that one follows the other then you can use it just like that
A,So for the purposes of this exercise we count it as just one sound effect
A,Uh what else
A,Okay good
A,And then
A,And then we have voices right
A,And we have more than one voice we'll treat each one of them as a separate element
A,So who do we have
A,We have Jenny right
A,We have Jenny Carol we have the announcer and the guy with no name okay
A,So we have seven elements in a simple thirty-second commercial
A,Okay so it's not as easy as you think it might be
A,Now we need to record all of them separately and so let's take a look at the elements and figure out how many tracks you would actually need to record on
A,Okay it is not seven it's going to be more than seven
A,The reason is because music always comes from left right down right
A,It's in stereo
A,Okay so we would we would need uh two tracks to record the music
A,Sound effects also in stereo so you need two over here two over here okay and the rest of them are voices not in stereo they're recorded in mono so you need one track each
A,Okay so that's one and ten right
A,So we would need a ten-track recorder to be able to record this commercial
A,Now there really is no such thing as a ten-track recorder
A,Okay they come in variables of two four eight sixteen twenty-four first okay then thirty-two thirty-six right
A,So for our commercial we would need which one of those
A,Sixteen okay we'll need a sixteen-track recorder
A,Do you see any around
A,Do you
A,Okay we don't have a sixteen-track recorder
A,Okay so strictly speaking if you're a professional trying to record this commercial you would need at least a sixteen-track recorder
A,What we're going to do today is to improvise a little bit okay
A,We're actually going to do some combining of elements in recording some elements uh on one track
A,So what we'll do is first uhm we would record the music on one channel so it'll no longer be in stereo it'll be in mono okay
A,And we'll do the same for the sound effects and the other sound effect and we will record all of the four voices on one channel okay
A,And we need a four-track recorder and do we have four-track recorder
A,Yes we do
A,Over here
A,So we'll actually use the four-track recorder and we'll improvise a little bit
A,Okay the commercial will not be in stereo but for the purposes of what we're trying to do today to do a multi-track recording that should be sufficient okay
A,And after this lesson you should be able to choose whether you want to adopt that kind of recording for putting your final projects together or if you want to if you want to do it the old way that you're familiar with mixing and re-mixing and re-mixing okay
A,Good
A,Now before we actually get started let me play back some of the elements
A,I've got on uhm the CD No <unclear> word </unclear> switch on the main <unclear> word </unclear>
A,Okay track fifty-two on this has either the the music or the sound effect
A,Let's see which one
A,Now uhm when you're looking for sound effects on a sound effect library or sound effect disk you may find ten fifteen different uh say party conversation each one slightly different okay
A,Even for something as simple as a car braking screeching to a halt there could be ten different ones because some of them take a long time to screech to a halt some of them stop immediately so they'll all come in uh different lengths
A,Okay
A,So you have to choose appropriately
A,Sometimes you may find there isn't really one that you can adopt for your commercial
A,In that case you actually have to go out and do the recording yourself
A,Now this party will do for this purpose but really it's it comprises of Caucasians speaking
A,It's not like an Asian crowd right
A,And uh at the party we want music that's playing in the background that we can mix together with the conversation to create that the whole effect
A,Okay on track forty-four on this one we have the
A,Okay with the music it would be better okay
A,So play together it would sound
A,Okay so with music in the background playing on and then we'll and then we'll mix more elements between the uh dialogue between the people involved
A,Okay not to mention the
A,And on the open reel I have already mixed for you the <unclear> word </unclear>
A,I think uh it's being played back at the wrong speed
A,Ya
A,Okay
A,So that's the sound of of a can of Norbecker punch being opened and poured into a glass
A,Okay
A,So you're you're familiar with all the elements that we're going to be using it's all there available <unclear> word </unclear> to put the <unclear> word </unclear> together
A,Now what are the things you will notice when you're actually uh get the talent in front of the microphones doing the actual recording is that when the conversation takes place cold without any of the sound effects and the ambien uh the ambience of the party it would sound very strange
A,It could even sound pretty tacky okay
A,Could you find that it gets a bit uh better when you mix it with the ambience
A,Okay
A,And it would be the same for the sound effect of the can popping it may seem unusual it may seem too obvious too loud okay
A,But next to everything it'll also get better
A,Any questions
A,Okay if no questions then you better get started putting the thing together because you don't have very much time
A,Since we only have two guys we're going to have a problem deciding uhm who's going to be the announcer and the guy I think it'll be a good idea to have a guy to be announcer alright because we have already two female voices and we don't want to have too many voices that sound alike okay
A,So I think uhm David would sound pretty good with the announcer
A,Okay and Robin of course would be the guy
A,And uh that's incredible I actually have names
A,Okay very good
A,So Jenny will be Jenny and okay
A,Now initially we don't really need you in front of the microphone okay
A,Let's try and figure out in what order we should uh put the commercial together
A,What's the first thing you would do
A,You know you start recording the elements one by one right
A,Okay which one will be the first one to record
A,Okay uh track one what will it be
A,Okay the okay the sound effects of the conversation and how long will you record that
A,Ya okay very good so we'll record for more than thirty seconds uh because we don't really know the commercial will be exactly thirty seconds so we can record more and during the final mix <unclear> word </unclear> we can actually get it out and off okay
A,So we'll record about uh say forty seconds okay
A,So we'll do that and then the next thing the music
A,Okay since those two actually last from the beginning till the end those are the first two that we'll do
A,Okay so on track two we record the music
A,Again for forty seconds right
A,And on track three the voices okay
A,Now you'll notice that before the sound effect of the can comes up the dialogue is actually interrupted right <X>
A,The dialogue is divided into two parts
A,t and one after the sound effect
A,So on track three we'll record the dialogue and up till the point when we hear the sound effect Okay and then on track four we'll record the sound effect and then we come back to track three and finish recording the dialogue
A,Okay then we'll sit down and mix the final commercial together okay
A,Now you're familiar with how the two-track machine works but you haven't used the four-track recorder yet okay
A,So if you'll gather around here let me demonstrate a few things that you should keep in mind
A,The four-track recorder is pretty much similar to the two-track recorder except that you can record <unclear> word </unclear> I mean the functions are more or less the same
A,To be able to record you want to put it on input
