1,So ancient
1,Ah okay okay
1,So we'll finish up the last chapter before we go on
1,Anyway they are all related to soil so it's quite okay
1,Right I think if I'm not mistaken did I did I finish up this with you
1,I did okay
1,Now I think uh this is too alright put it forward there
1,Thank you
1,Put it down
1,Okay we borrowed from the other class
1,Alright uhm did I show you the vertical section of uh <unclear> word </unclear> soil
1,Now we have been talking about the different soil type okay so in agriculture we actually make use of certain part of the soil that is the top soil for our plants which we harvest after a few weeks' time okay like vegetables for example alright
1,We grow them because the roots are not deep-seated so they occupy the top soil level
1,Now plants which grow in the soil for I mean the roots uh uh penetrate the soil deeper will penetrate to the subsoil level uh which uh as we know not very fertile
1,Ya okay and then of course most soil will not be able to reach the bed-rock level
1,So most of the time we are making use of the top soil
1,Right tying your hair now is it
1,Now this one its its experiment uhm we did is this ah something like that ya
1,Uhm this is to show you which level is occupied by what
1,The lower levels would be stones then we have large particles then small particles silt very small particles clay human and living material right
1,So the top part okay
1,This is when we get a soil sample and then you put in water alright
1,And this last one here shows you the interactions that happen in soil alright you have got this
1,Okay let's start from the <unclear> word </unclear>
1,Okay let's start from the left hand side rain water gets into the soil
1,Uhm we have plants which has group nodules so we have these nodules which can take nitrogen from the air alright
1,The rain water drained away by gravity
1,Some of these water are absorbed is absorbed by the plant alright taken up by the plant
1,At the same time you have nitrates which is due uhm done by micro <unclear> word </unclear> bacteria and all these it contributes nitrate to the soil
1,These nitrates will be taken up by the plants okay
1,Others will leach off alright
1,Then you have when the the uhm leaves fall and they decay after they have died so the bacteria and fungi will uh act on them decompose them and contribute nitrates to the soil
1,Of course we also have earthworm and other organism which are macro right in the soil which would uh contribute to the fertility of the soil by uh when they fall around they actually create uh what do you call that they aerate the soil okay
1,So others we have mentioned before uh
1,Alright so this is the uh what is actually happening in the soil right
1,Okay okay
1,Right then we have a summary of the properties of sand and clay right
1,Now property texture okay particle size sorry sand you have large particle size whereas clay very small texture sand coarse texture soil is light and easy to work
1,You have you have handled soil yesterday uh sand yesterday right
1,The difference between soil and clay and sand
1,You can actually tell the difference
1,Root penetration is easy but root support is poor because they are uhm uhm it's it does not hold the root tightly okay
1,And for clay it's very fine heavy difficult to work
1,Root penetration is difficult but root support is good
1,It's difficult for the root to penetrate but to support the root the clay soil is actually the best alright
1,Uhm air content uh for sand it's high large air spaces among the particles whereas for clay it's low small closely adhering particles okay
1,Porosity very porous water draining off readily whereas it's the opposite here
1,And you have water-retaining capacity
1,For sand it's uh very poor the soil tends to be dry and over here good but easily water-logged that means the water stay in there alright
1,And the rest with capillarity we have done this
1,Mineral salts content for sand low as soluble salts are readily drained away because they they allow water to drain off readily alright
1,And for clay it's high since salts are not draining off alright
1,So if you are a plant uhm and you are found in areas where you can only find sand and you want to germinate uhm such plants would need to have special adaptional features like for example sandy soil
1,If you are growing near the beach alright then you need to have features which will enable you to stand upright as well as uh absorb nutrients okay
1,So uhm do you know which plants are found in sandy soil
1,Cactus
1,In sandy soil is it
1,Desert okay
1,Alright
1,Are there any but cactus is because they do not need as much water they they store the leaves
1,Ya okay okay
1,What about uh coconut yes coconut what what others
1,Casuarina okay
1,The casuarina casuarina has a very specific uhm root system in the sense that it's very deep-rooted alright and it can uhm uh anchor very well
1,That's why you see casuarina tree is actually uite big and could survive uh beach condition okay
1,So uh clay soil will be you must be able to you know penetrate and uhm after that it's okay for you but in terms of getting water it'll be a bit difficult alright
1,Okay and also you must be able to uhm survive in the area if let's say it's water-logged your root system must be good enough such that it will not rot okay or you do not need as much aeration in your root system alright
1,So that's the adaptation okay
1,Any uestion
1,No
1,Then we go on to soil fertility This the last part uh after this we'll be going on to new chapter
1,Alright soil fertility
1,I think you have this set of notes right
1,If you want to take down points next to your notes please do so
1,Most of you did not bring your notes
1,Alright soil fertility depends on soil composition The composition of clay and sand is important
1,If you are in the if you are growing in the region or rather if you are a plant you grow in the region where there is only clay it's very bad only sand is very bad
1,You will be very lucky if you can find a place where you have good soil and then germinate and grow
1,Uhm that is the reason why dispersal of seed is very important
1,If the if if you make use of a very good dispersal mechanism ah then you'll land in a good place and you will sprout there okay
1,So uhm most of the time plants will produce lots of seed so that just in case you know uhm only a few of them would find a good place to germinate alright and a lot of time also the seeds are able to uhm remain dormant that is they do not germinate at all if they are uh blown to a place whereby the condition is not right
1,So they will just stay there dormant and hope that another gust of wind or animal or whatever will bring them to somewhere else to germinate okay
1,So soil condition is very very important to plants alright
1,So the soil should be well-aerated can retain some water so that uh leaching will not remove the soluble salts alright
1,Uhm fertility of the soil depends on pH If it is the soil is acidic then usually it's infertile because acidity makes the mineral salts very soluble alright and therefore these mineral salts when they are soluble in the water it will leach off
1,So that your soil becomes poor because all your mineral salt or most of the mineral salts would have been gone will have leached off okay
1,UHM alkaline soils usually fertile high in mineral salts content
1,But if it is too high then the salts are insoluble and therefore cannot be taken up by plants
1,So again uh you have to strike a balance
1,Okay
1,Uhm but soil fertility is usually maintained by activities of organisms living on or in it
1,This I've mentioned bacteria blue-ridge algae actinomycetes fungi protozoa nematodes arthropods and earthworms alright
1,Fertility is lost in agriculture alright
1,Natural cycles interrupted
1,If you if you uh use a piece of land for agriculture you do not allow the natural cycle to occur you see because you are ploughing you're using the land for your own purpose alright
1,So you are interrupting the natural cycle okay and therefore crops removed and not left to decay
1,Because what you want is harvest so you remove your crops In actual natural situation is the <unclear> word </unclear> will be allowed to decompose and so on after they have gone through a cycle
1,But if it is an <unclear> word </unclear> piece of land then that is not possible and so you are disrupting nature okay
1,Nutrients are not returned to soil because it is through decomposition that nutrients enter the soil alright
1,Okay
1,Types of soil
1,We have uh different types of soil for different purposes okay
1,Sedentary soil okay situated on top of rock from which it is developed by weathering
1,Remember when we did soil we said that uhm soil is obtained when we through weathering of rock and so on
1,So this the most or rather im immediate supply will be when rocks become weathered down by uh the different rain sun and all this type okay so you get sedentary soil alluvial soil will be composed of mineral particles which have been carried long distances from their place of origin through valley bottom and coastal plain and usually this is through by this is by what
1,How how are these soil transported
1,Ah
1,Again water rain natural elements okay natural elements wind and so on okay
1,Alright Topsoil and subsoil okay are with the top type of soil
1,You have loam soil yesterday we give we we we did not have a chance to do loam soil but we had what uh what soil as you know in garden soil okay that is uh after it has been treated uh okay
1,Loam soil is supposed to be more fertile
1,Uhm I told you before long ago in agricultural land like in in different part of Singapore where there are Kampong areas right
1,I told you that right
1,How people get loam soil okay
1,Remember or not
1,No I didn't tell you
1,Okay uhm usually long ago let's say long ago means less than fifteen years ago or twenty years ago
1,Okay we have got uh small corners around Singapore where we have Kampong and people living in kampong they have small uh pieces of land where they grow their vegetables okay
1,So it's like self-sufficient alright
1,Now to get the fertilizer uh they normally do not use natural ferti uh artificial fertilizer that they they do not put fertilizer on into the soil
1,So what they do is uh waste like uh paper decomposing leaves and so on they will collect that alright and pile up in a heap and uh they will sun these you know uh turn them over and sun and dry
1,The after a few weeks they will light a match burn them
1,So to you it might be environmental pollution but the effect is actually good because after burning these down become ashes and so on in a big pile okay
1,So a lot of carbon uh nitrates and so on <unclear> word </unclear> they do it they dig a hole bury these things inside alright keep them there <X>
1,Then after some time alright they they do turn it over and over and after about two three weeks you'll find that the soil is become actual uh soil condition black soil okay and you'll have lots of earthworms there
1,So they take this soil and they grow their vegetables okay
