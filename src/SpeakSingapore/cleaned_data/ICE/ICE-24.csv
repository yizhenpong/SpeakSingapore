B,Since they've been there for about four years
A,She says the building is nice but not that wonderful
A,But the view is from there is excellent
B,But I think the <unclear> word </unclear> building is unusual
A,You know
B,Because all these buildings are connected to one another and there's no exposure to the rain and the sun
B,I think that was what <unclear> word </unclear> told us last time wasn't it
A,Ya it seems ya ya
B,Uhm
A,Eh actually we should walk round the buildings
A,We have not walked
A,We have not even been into the main uh building itself
B,Oh we managed to see quite a lot during the convocation
B,Sam's convocation
A,Ya that ya that's the
B,Uhm
A,That's the open space itself but not the the halls and the enclosed areas
B,Uhm we did go in
B,A short while I remember

B,Would it
A,Uhm
B,So far we had the meetings ending only about nine thirty
A,Oh ya ya

A,This speaker this tape recorder and speaker is very interesting
A,Small thing like that and it's
B,It's supposed to take uh take eh to catch your voice from a long distance
A,Is it
B,Yeah
B,I think this is called a uni- <unclear> word </unclear> microphone <unclear> word </unclear>
A,Uhm This morning I was listening to the tape I bought from Malacca some years back Cantigas
A,Cantigas I think is Portuguese music Portuguese singing
A,Portuguese uh singing is very lively
A,Oh ya by the way uh Loonie rang up last night
A,Loonie I I'm not sure whether he rang from Singapore or from Philippines
A,He didn't indicate that
A,But he rang
A,I don't I don't know why he rang also
B,Ya I I don't know whether to bring up the matter to elders in his unit uh tomorrow evening
A,Uhm
B,I think it's not necessary huh
A,Don't no need lah
A,Doesn't doesn't uh really uh interest them
B,Now Aileen Hu's uh the the dinner is on for Tuesday
A,Uhm uhm where will it be
B,I think it should be at the Singapore
B,Let me see
B,Airlines Club what do you call it
B,SIA Club
A,Uhm uhm
B,SIA Club ya
B,Seems that anybody could go there eh for the dinner or for for the meals
A,It's different for our club
B,Uhm
A,Our club is so exclusive
A,I I I don't know the fact that they have to charge visitors who come in for just for a meal
B,Well they've got their reason I suppose otherwise there'll be all sorts of all all sorts of people coming in
A,Ya but if members uh members sign them in it's okay what
A,I mean shouldn't shouldn't uh make it that difficult for members to have a guest for dinner or for lunch
A,Or of course lunch-time it's anybody can come in on work on working days not on weekends nor public holidays but uhm working days they allow that
B,Uhm You see in Chinese Swimming Club they have a separate entrance going to the restaurant so people use just use that entrance and come out exactly in the same way
A,Uhm
B,Whereas in our club uh you have entrance going to the swimming pool as well as to the billiards room as well as to uh you know the other facilities rooms
A,Anyway I don't like the Chinese Swimming Club <X>
A,It's so much like a little uh uh uh a mini-China
B,Uhm
A,The colour is blue and the new uh pool with its building has got such uh poor taste The archi architecture is such
B,It's Chinese what That's
A,The architecture is so bad
B,I mean that's typical Chinese what <unclear> word </unclear>
A,I I don't know I feel as thouh I'm in China when I see <unclear> word </unclear> look at that building I'm in that in that ang in that space there
B,Ya uhm What we don't really appreciate is enclosed feeling that we get when we go there whereas we
A,It's so different from our from the Changi Beach Club
B,Uhm uhm
A,where you have the sea right in front of you and the breeze
