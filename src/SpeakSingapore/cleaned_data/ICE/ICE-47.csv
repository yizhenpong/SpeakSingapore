A,She confided in me you know
A,She even said like I don't know whether I am going to enjoy tonight's dinner
A,I think she was kind of feeling a little bit apprehensive about meeting her very popular predecessor uhm
B,Oh
A,But it turned out all right in the end because Maureen in her usual manner was like uhm full of life uhm full of electricity
B,Oh I see
B,Oh you mean you really had her doubts ah
A,Ya ya
B,But uhm
A,That's what she said
A,I don't know whether I would enjoy tonight's dinner
B,That was precisely why I didn't turn up actually
A,Really
B,Yes I didn't want to <unclear> word </unclear>
A,Because you were afraid of meeting Maureen
B,Not Maureen like I I
B,The point was that I I wasn't sure I would enjoy the dinner because I didn't want to sit in the same at the table as Madame
A,Oh
B,I got really
A,Oh she was
B,pissed off
B,Ya
A,She was quite pleasantly charming that evening
B,Which was surprising like so out of character
B,But uhm ya Yvonne was still here at that time and she she wasn't really invited
A,Oh oh
B,And she said I wouldn't even go if they paid me a million bucks
B,So I was beginning to wonder when what what would I be doing there I wouldn't even enjoy myself
B,So that's why I decided to
A,Oh but you had every right to be there because it was supposed to be like in celebration of uh the new year's dinner or no no no
A,Uhm who's farewell dinner was that
A,Tony Tan's farewell dinner
B,Tony Tan ya
A,Ya it was supposed to well celebrate all the good work that we have done
A,Not really celebrate but it was a thank you dinner for all of us
A,So you had every right to be there more so than me than Mabel than Ellice
B,It was it was Mabel and and Sunstroke
B,I didn't do anything for Tony Tan
A,Oh okay
B,And then I like and how was I to know that would that would be like a birthday thing added to it
A,Whose birthday was it
B,It's mine
A,Oh
B,So then later on later on they they they gave the cake to Maureen
A,Oh did they give the cake to Maureen
A,No it was brought back to the office
B,No no ya but they they wheeled the thing to Maureen the trolley
A,Oh oh Doreen ya Doreen sounded so much like Maureen
B,Ya hang on a minute
B,Hello uh ya get back to you
B,Okay bye
A,Who was that
B,Uh Den Dennis lah
A,Oh checking on you
B,I don't know he was quite cheesed off about that that talk that I had with that gentleman yesterday
A,What gentleman was that
B,The one that you said that you insisted was wearing a wig
A,Oh really
B,Uhm
A,But Dennis shouldn't be jealous of every man you speak to especially as this one is like uh golden opportunity for you
B,Ya but he with the golden hair
B,Uhm the way you put it golden opportunity
A,Now the thing is uhm he just is and uhm he
B,But then I side-track and console him by saying that oh don't worry about me
B,Echon <unclear> word </unclear> says he looks fuuny you know
B,Even she wasn't impressed at all and she was insist she insisted that he was wearing a wig
B,You can't for the life of him be real you know real hair
B,So he said uh okay
A,Maybe there is something in the way you describe all these men to him maybe
B,No all I could
A,That's why he's always so jealous
B,All I could have to say is he's a male and okay that's it
B,Out comes the horns and the green shade and what not
A,Oh is it all right if he were to speak to females
A,It's okay it's perfect okay right
B,Ah he reckons that I am a dangerous person
A,Oh I suppose like
B,Really like
A,Maybe I suppose if he finds it difficult to resist you he probably believes that all men feel this way
B,What a joke
B,What a real joke
B,No I don't think that's the case
B,I think he is just plain jealous spot <unclear> word </unclear>
B,Do you know that yesterday
A,Anyway uh men are so unreasonable you know
B,Definitely
B,I mean they're like they are still living in the Stone Age
A,Uhm they have double standards
B,Uhm
A,Uhm then what else can we think of
A,Ya I must similar problems with my boyfriend too
B,Really
B,I thought he was
A,So cool <unclear> word </unclear>
B,So that's why his friends keep tabs on you ah
A,Well he thinks I am damn helpless uh
A,He probably is not aware that I am so much more intelligent than him in every way
A,Ah how does he know I am not pretending to be helpless just to make him feel good
A,That's why I tell you men are so damn stupid
B,No oh ya that's what I go through
B,I always play the like fragile dame damsel in distress
B,And he that's what that was the term that he used for to describe me fragile
A,Oh that's exactly the term that my boyfriend uses to describe me too
B,Really
B,Oh
A,Yes I mean you find it hard to believe right knowing me
A,That's why that's why they don't know what they're talking about you know
A,They're just so stupid
B,Fragile fragile ah okay uhm
A,Well I suppose like uhm they have this uhm sort of believe dreams that they want their women to be this way
A,They want their women to be that way you know
B,And they always want to play hero
B,They want to be the hero
A,Oh ya so tough but in my case he likes it that I am independent and
B,And he wishes you to be more independent than you already are or to show him
A,No
B,That you are more independent than what you are showing him now
A,Actually he allows me to be independent because I am supposed to be on home ground
A,So I cannot go round right being on home ground
A,Gee what a weird way of thinking
B,I think that that's where you can go wrong
B,Definitely wrong because you are more familiar with the territory
A,Uhm that's right
B,And you can be up to more nonsense than
A,Ya true
B,If you're on foreign ground
A,Ya
B,Because this is your territory
A,Quite true but anyway
B,What he doesn't know doesn't wouldn't hurt him right
A,Uhm no
A,His rationale is that well I'm in home ground so I can be allowed a lot more freedom
A,But later on when we move away and I am in a strange land than I think he would sort of keep uh
B,Closer tabs
A,Ya that's right
B,Really
A,I think so
B,So no wonder you were saying is like bye bye to freedom in more ways than one
A,No he probably thinks that uhm that you know I'll behave myself when I am here because uhm well
A,But you know over there I might not behave myself so much
B,Oh
B,Is her right
A,I think he's wrong
A,I'll probably behave myself there
A,Anyway I don't have time to go around
B,Ya you'll probably be so busy and caught up with your work
A,Uhm okay lah let's not talk about men they're such boring subjects
B,Ya but you kind of live with them you can't live without them
A,Oh that's what they say about us too right
A,Who said that uh
A,I seem to remember hearing these words just uh a few days ago
A,Were you the one who said it
B,Nope not me
A,Who told me the same thing
B,It's a common phrase so you know
A,Oh but someone one said it and in this context too when we're talking about
B,Men
A,No that person was talking about women
B,Oh
A,And he was saying like you can't live with them and you can't live without them
A,He was referring to women
A,Now who was it uh
A,Ah well I guess that's my boyfriend's right
A,I have too many boy-friends
B,Can't remember
A,I don't know who tells me what uhm okay
B,Probably
A,Okay let's get back to our office politics here you know that's more interesting
A,So what do you think will happen now if uhm our friend Maureen comes back
A,Oh but she'll be so much it it'll be so much if she comes back and when I'm still around
A,But not likely to be I suppose
B,Probably not but uhm well I heard from somebody that she actually she she actually stepped on a few toes while she was here
A,She steps on her toes
B,Oh and but
A,But she is a great favourite with the boss
B,Ya but like if she step on her toes than why the hell does she we're all excreted to
A,Oh well I think she has been specifically instructed by the man himself to say that we're so happy to hear that you're coming back you know
A,And all that uh I tell you that woman can be so double faced you know
B,Probably
A,Well
B,Are you going out to lunch
A,Uh I had my lunch uhm and actually I had a very heavy lunch
A,Had potatoes and had salad I
B,Where
A,Potato Kentucky Fried Chicken you know
B,Oh you went out
A,The soft potato that whipped potato
B,You went out
A,No actually it was yesterday's one
A,I couldn't finish it I couldn't eat it at all in the fridge
A,Oh you're ribbons are quite nice
B,Yap so you just tie
A,Actually uhm how much did it cost you buy these ribbons
B,Uhm if you get a ready made one it's sixty cents
B,But if you get the whole roll like you know something like this it's two bucks
A,Oh ya
B,Then you can make
A,I suppose it's more economical
B,Ya what it's so troublesome
B,I mean I did one to show Jenny Jenny's daughter how to do it and that was it
B,I never expected her to like come back and say please ask me to make another one
A,Uhm uh
B,So well hack
B,'Cause I'm not doing anything
B,Anyway I told Ellice very flatly I have lost the desire to work
A,And then what happens now
B,I don't know I just wait and see whether that guy's offer comes through
B,If it does I'll be so glad to go away
A,Oh where is her now
B,He's somewhere in Singapore
B,He'll be here for the next couple of days and after that he's going back to Sydney
A,Oh and
B,So I don't know
A,Ha has he got your address
A,He may write to you from there
B,He's going to fax me from Sydney
A,Would it be wise
B,So
A,I mean people would be able to read you know your letters
B,Uhm
A,Maybe he should write to you instead of faxing
B,Well I gave him the card my card here and I I could always get in touch with him before I leave
B,So uhm I hope
A,Well anyway even after you leave and you expect faxes I can take them for you and pass it to you so no problem okay
B,No no
B,I not that worried 'cause Jenny's the one closest to the fax
B,So she's on the look out
A,Oh ya
A,That's right you know
B,So that's okay you know
A,Uhm but make sure it doesn't get into the wrong hands because you'll never know
B,I know I know
B,Our bosses are like dead curious I think because like both of them saw me with him and if and they were pretty curious judging from the expressions
B,Because like Miss Ng walking up and down three times and even when he was in my room she like went to and fro Mabel's room a couple of times and each time non fail she look in and Sakuma was passing like walking up and down like for no apparent reason <X>
