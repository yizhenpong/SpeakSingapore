A,Actually the the only thing that we have uh I mean the don't know lah I mean my school we we we we always thought that the that the headquarters didn't like us
B,Why
A,There is some kind of conception or misconception or some sort lah
B,Really
A,I mean because we we we won a lot of competitions
B,True
A,Ya the fact I mean my my school like swept a lot of prizes you see so uh uh it was like oh well I mean you've won so many why don't you give other schools a chance you know
A,Oh hi Lyn
B,Hi
A,You want to me in this
B,We are still talking
B,If you want to join in and take over from me then I can make my move
B,Are you sure
B,That is about another twenty more minutes to go
B,It's just talking to us I mean
A,Making conversation
A,Okay all right
A,Ya so so ya I mean I they they they they thought that that we won a little too many lah so ya but there was well I always thought Red Cross should stand for uh the first aid sign lah
A,So actually when when I don't know I uhm when when my my school did better in foot drill I I did question the the rationale
A,Look you know what I mean
A,This you are you're you're supposed surely ought to be better in first aid
A,What I mean isn't what the Red cross is all about
A,Ya so I guess the people were not very happy because obviously you know the foot drill was such a big thing in the Red Cross as well
B,Well I think they view in terms of like like all uniform-groups
B,One of the obvious reason or objective is to have discipline
A,That's true
B,So if you don't have discipline then you can't do a lot of things
A,That's true that's true
B,So I that is the reason why I I was actually put in charge of the drills
A,All right
B,Discipline is very important
A,Right
A,I remember I was in charge of a pla platoon and uh they were all juniors of course
A,I was senior at that time you see and uh they actually uh could not do a drill well
A,You know the timing is important and all that so uh there was one particular drill where actually which the they form and the was not up to par and I I I while I make a big hoo ha out of it and then they cried after that
A,It was quite quite uh uh quite dramatic in a sense but I think I was trying to stress to them the importance of it
A,Teamwork very important because we are training for competition formation where you have to be very precise and you have to cooperate with each other
A,So if you don't cooperate then there is not uniformity at all so that that was uh one of things I remember when I was in school that time
A,So I guess you didn't really like much drills and all that
A,No actually uh for foot drill I did quite well
A,Ya I think I did quite well at foot drill
A,I enjoyed uhm ya the formations and all that lah
A,I mean it was like quite fun lah you know but there is a lot of hard work lah and I think that because of because of so much drill actually uhm you know physiologically my legs like grew a lot more than my arms
B,Longer
A,Not not longer but I think the the leg muscles are a lot better develop or my leg muscles are a lot better develop than than muscles elsewhere on my body you see
A,Ya so my father said that if you don't do push ups you look like a kangaroo
A,Ya anyway I I actually join the Red Cross because uh I I was hoping to to practice uh to go into medical practice
B,Oh I see
A,Ya so it was like you know look you know there there is some kind of connections so why don't I just use it like a trump card lah so to speak
A,But actually I mean all my involvement with Red Cross uh wasn't I mean I I I don't think the the universities took it very seriously because you say oh well you know my interest
A,Ya I got Red-cross to to prove four years but apparently the the university isn't very interested because I got some other friends who did a lot better at their A levels which Red Cross took book as well and still didn't make it to in medical school so ya I suppose
B,So why did you go into law
A,Uhm
B,How did you go into law then
A,Uh I thought on the strength of my English language competency lah
A,Ya
B,What do you mean by competency
A,No I mean it's like I I think I'm I'm I'm fairly comfortable with the English language so
B,Written and oral
A,Written and oral written oral so uh well I mean if if if if if I am really lousy at the Sciences you know why don't I at least use some asset that I have which is competency in English so you know use it in in in in a field of study which which requires that kind of command
A,Uh uh I mean I I won't consider myself proficient lah because there are a lot of words which I still don't use don't know how to use don't know the meaning of so uh ya
B,What's your opinion now of this Singlish
B,Do you think that we should talk the way the other Singaporeans are talking or should we talk the way we have been uh taught and brought up to to to speak like a normal you know rofessional at work
A,Well I think it depends on the uh situation in which you use your language
A,Uhm
B,Let us say now we are talking I mean would would it would be more like uh personal right
B,Let us say the situation calls for it then uh we have of course uh some Singlish thing you know injected into it the conversation
A,Ya it is true I uh I mean obviously if you want to do a professional presentation then you jolly well mind your grammmar
B,That's that is true that is important
A,Just like when we are we are delivering a lecture then I think it has to be of course of a certain standard not so much Singlish but the Singlish is used to illustrate a probably a a some some what you call uh some jokes along the way to make the lecture more interesting and to also the relate to the students who are more more or less uh very localise in the <unclear> word </unclear> in the Singaporean uh context
B,Ya no but uh you know have you ever considered this this question
B,If supposing now like like for instance right now uh Ngee Ann Poly you know they they have this Business Chinese Business Mandarin course right
B,Uhm I mean suggesting that actually the the level of lang of of Mandarin spoken in Singapore is not really quite up to par so that is why you got to use uh uh you you got to teach uhm Singaporean Chinese the proper Chinese words which which is understood in Taiwan or or in China
B,I mean isn't if if supposing we all spoke Chinese I mean don't you think there is an equivalent in the Chinese language of Singish
B,Yes yes
A,Right
A,So you know uh
B,Similar
A,A a similar problem as well
B,Ya ya
B,But is is the problem that big
B,I thought that is not that critical as far as Chinese
A,It is not
B,Not as critical as I know
B,Well if let's say uh we speak to a Taiwanese now in Mandarin or to a China Chinese in the normal Chinese language uh or Mandarin for that matter I think they still can understand us but if you talk about say dialects let us say uh in a different provinces uh then I think it may be a bit difficult
B,But by and large Chinese I think still I think it is still all right
A,Okay well I mean because quite quite definitely like in class where where we meet with the students and you hear them speak in Mandarin
A,I mean quite obviously it is not hundred per cent Mandarin all the way isn't it
B,True also
A,Because they they drop in all kinds of words and and all kind I mean they they twist the expressions the other way you see so that it it it follows uh uh maybe the English pattern of of speaking right they just translate it
B,Ya direct translation
A,Ya ya that is right
A,So ya
B,But I suppose it also depends on who who is talking who you are talking to
A,Well true I mean if we all talk in Man if we all use Mandarin to teach and I suppose we would all have to speak what up to scratch Mandarin but I mean even now when we teach in English we I actually we don't speak up to scratch in English isn't it
B,No not at all
A,I I mean like for me I know I I drop in a lot of localised expressions
B,Ya just to you know like I said to the whole
A,Loosen up ya developing a rapport
B,But one thing I I feel that it is quite unfortunate is that we have hardly any opportunity to really uhm to use Mandarin or speak Mandarin
B,Like in my previous job I I still do get the opportunity to do so because of the Chinese-speaking uh population uh the manufacturers
A,You will deal with them uh
B,I deal with them I have to talk with them in their lingo although it is American Multinational
B,Uhm but now now that in the teaching profession very difficult unless I am teaching a Chinese class but I think that is uh a bit too difficult lah
A,Ya correct
B,In terms of our language ability to really teach the subject in Mandarin so to speak probably takes a while to really get a hang of it
A,Ya I know I got some
B,All the concepts
A,I got some students who who want me to speak in Chinese sometimes
A,I mean once in a while I do feel quite tempted but it is like if I did that then it would only encourage them to think Chinese and they don't improve in their English but
B,And they are supposed to be writing in their English medium uh in exams or whatever projects and <unclear> word </unclear>
A,You know but in a sense I do sympathise with them because they say look you know what I mean
A,It's it's not that we want to how should I say it's it's to aid them in their understanding of the concept
A,Expression of course is another way lah but what is the concept they have this problem you see so I mean ya I I do agree lah that sometimes I wish I could use Chinese or you know but a lot of reservations
B,Ya in case we say the wrong thing
A,Ya I suppose it is like I don't want to be laughed at
B,I mean we want to show the best side of what we are
B,Okay it's about three fifty
A,Ya all right
B,I think we have to call it at a call it off at this moment
B,We're running out of things to say
A,All right then
B,We certainly hope you find the thing useful and let us know have some feedback at the end of it all
A,That was T G speaking
A,Thank you
