A,And then after there's
B,The tea ceremony
A,That's at your home
B,Ya
A,Who's that
B,No that's that's someone from Geography Department
B,So they pang the pang teh would be at about four four pm or four-thirty at my place
A,What's happening to church ceremony
A,Are they singing or something
B,They're going to sing then the bride's coming in
B,Then they're going to say <unclear> word </unclear>
A,Together are they
B,No they don't there's no performance or anything in the church itself
A,The last few weddings I've been to don't know what they're like
B,Whose wedding
A,Lilian's wedding
B,But no one sang for them
A,Yes No they had a duet
B,Oh they sang together
A,Don't you remember
B,They didn't sing
B,Peng Ling and her husband sang right
A,Ya
B,Is that right
A,Ya like who or was it that
B,No I I remember Peng Nan sang for
A,Peng Nan and the wife as well
B,Oh ya ya ya that's true
B,That's nice because they're so sporting but uhm Geraldine doesn't want to sing and Yen has a
A,A wedding is not the to be sporting
B,That's true and Yen is tone deaf also
A,Tone deaf
B,Oh so he claims
B,So
A,But is anybody in the church singing for them
B,Uh no they don't want anything so no one is gonna to do anything
B,I won't be MCing anything at all in the wedding in the church
A,You're definitely not the the bestman
B,There's no bestman and there's no bride's maid either
A,Oh doesn't she have a sister or something
B,Yes but they don't want bride's maid and best man
B,What's strange also is they want to break tra tradition in so many ways that it's so ridiculous like
A,Like what
B,They said that they don't want anyone to stand up when the bride comes in so everyone will be seated when the bride comes in
A,But then you you know unless you specifically tell
B,Oh they're no they're gonna specifically tell people that
A,Oh because otherwise some will stand up and some would sit down
B,Ya so he would say uhm
A,Can you please sit down for the bride
B,The bride and groom specifically ask that you sit down for the
A,Why
B,Uh Geraldine said she doesn't want uh whenever people stand up people will be like trying to look at the bride and then a lot of people won't see
B,If you sit down everyone has an equal opportunity to see her anyway so
A,Well I suppose there's some logic in there
B,Well and then they showed me their wedding photos on last oh well last week
B,And her evening gown she said that she took the best of everything
B,Maybe <unclear> word </unclear> she went through the whole catalogue then she said I like the bodies of this I like the sleeve of that I like the skirt of that came out looking so terrible
A,Oh you seen it it's not
B,She herself even said
B,Aiyah now that it's combine it looks very sloppy because if you noticed all that Peng Ling is so all body hugging right
A,Ya ya ya
B,And if you're slim that's quite nice
A,That's okay
B,In it she is slim but her dress came up looking like it's very soft and flowy
B,Here it's very soft and flowy below so it becomes
