A,Things like Word Perfect uhm Lotus
B,You know how
A,I don't think you are that familiar with it
B,You know how to operate Word Perfect
A,Of course I'm very good at it okay
A,It's time for you to learn
B,Okay so uh besides this what else do you do
A,Well I just started so basically these are my two main portfolios
B,How how do you rate your uh working environment
A,It's very good
A,Uhm everybody there is very helpful to one another and we we click along
B,Oh and uh where do you usually have lunch

A,Uhm we usually buy back and we watch videos
A,Yah like the latest one we just finished watching Jurassic Park
B,On a video
A,On a video yes
B,Would wouldn't that take away a lot of the fun
B,But you have seen Jurassic Park before right
A,No yes I've seen that's why I this is second time round
B,Okay
A,Yes so what about you
B,What have I been doing
A,Yes
B,Oh I basically I've been just watching watching movies and going shopping and uh
A,Bought a lot of things
B,Yah I bought a lot of things
A,<unclear> word </unclear>
B,So uh I've seen In the line of Fire
A,Aye tell me what is it
B,This one good
B,You know all this
B,This okay is like you know Clint Eastwood right
B,So it's about this guy who is a retired no he's not retired he's a he's a very old F B I agent so
A,Is he still working now or
B,He's working but the first time uhm he was suppose to protect uh J F K when he was shot you see and somehow when when he heard the shot right he couldn't react in time you see
B,So this time ha there's a there's this uhm this this man who wants to assassinate the president you know and he calls this Clint Eastwood up you see and carries on this cat and mouse
A,Chase
B,Chase
B,Speak to him over the phone
B,At the time he would leave some clues so it's that he will bring the police quite nearly and at the end he will always keep one step ahead
B,So the whole story is about how uhm I mean yah lah the typical
A,So how he finally he solve the case
B,But the thing thing about the show is there's are a lot of uhm characterisation so
A,Like
B,In terms of the characters lah
B,You feel like very real you know
B,It's not like some Rambo style or Fugitive
B,You have this super super edition man running around and all this getting ahead of their you know
A,So it's like more realistic than
B,Yah this is more realistic and the people are more real you see
B,They've more depth to the character and uh yah
A,Okay
B,Okay the other show I saw was Dave
A,Okay
B,It's also about about this man who uhm who was to look like the president you see
B,So while he was used as a stand in for the president when the president goes into the public so instead of the president going to public he go into public
A,Why
B,Because uh just prevent the president from being shot or or
A,Okay
B,But what happens is uh in the end the president died you see of a heart attack
A,So he has to continue to put up
B,Oh he died of he died of a stroke while having an affair with his secretary
A,Okay
B,So what happen is the the the Chief-Of-Staff right keep the impostor in as he would control him you know
A,Yes yah yah
B,So the story goes lah
B,Both of the both of the films sort of like make it sort of like symbolises the American's disillusionment with the government
A,President
B,Because they always portray the government officials as bureacratics or just just for their own gains and for their own selfish uh own
A,But it's quite difficult right actually
B,So and usually portray them as uh you know the president is always portrayed as a useless person you see and the good guys are always the the everyday guy you know the <unclear> word </unclear>
