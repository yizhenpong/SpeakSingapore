A,Doctor Wee if I may be permitted to go through the injuries with you
A,Look at the external injuries according to the post-mortem report
A,The external injuries started from one two three four five and so on
A,We will start with the first one
A,Superficial cut on the left forehead across the left upper eyelid
A,Do you have a copy of the photographs
B,You are taking Doctor Wee through the external injuries
A,Through all the slash wounds and stab wounds and with reference to the photographs
B,Yes
A,First injury on your medical report
A,Doctor Wee could you take a look
C,Yes this is seen in P thirty-one
B,P thirty-one
B,Superficial cut on left forehead is it
A,This is a cut on the face around the eye and down to the cheek
A,On the face right
C,Yes
B,The one you see in P thirty-one
C,Yes
B,Coming down the nose is it
C,Inner aspect of the left
B,Inner aspect of the left eye all right
A,That is the first injury
A,This would be consistent Doctor Wee with
A,Would it be consistent with injury caused by a sharp object
C,Sharp instrument
A,Such as a parang
C,Yes the tip of the parang
A,The second injury Doctor Wee is a slash wound with sharp edges and forked anterior tip over the occipita-parietal scalp where would that
C,This is seen in P thirty-four and thirty-five
A,P thirty-four shows the injury with the hair still on his head
C,Yes
A,And P thirty thirty-five with the head shaved
C,Yes
A,Could you briefly describe this wound to us
A,It has not penetrated the skull
A,It did not crack the skull or
C,It did not go into the skull cavity or affected the brain
A,But it has cut through the skin and flesh of the head until it reaches the skull
C,Yes
C,It only cut the thickness of the scalp and outer table of the skullbone
A,And this would also be consistent with the injuries caused
C,By a sharp instrument like that of parang
A,Third injury Doctor Wee is an tangential slash wound
C,Yes
C,This is seen in P thirty-five
A,P thirty-five also
C,And thirty-three
A,This is where part of the scalp being slashed off
C,Yes
B,One moment P
A,Thirty-three and thirty-five
A,Thirty-three is the injury
B,Somewhere near the ear is it
A,Yes where part of the scalp is sliced off
A,Doctor Wee could you see photographs eight and nine
C,Yes
A,Would that be the piece of scalp that had been sliced off
C,Yes it would
A,My Lord the scale in eight and nine was found in the hotelroom
B,Yes
A,And this injury is again consistent with that caused by a sharp instrument
C,Like that of a parang
A,Before I go on to the other I go on to the injuries first
A,The neck has no injuries
C,No
A,The injury on the chest
A,There is a vertical slash wound on the right anterior shoulder with sharp edges
A,Where can you find this
C,It is seen in P thirty-five and thirty-one
A,There is a deep slash wound on the right shoulder isn't it
C,Yes
B,Again sharp instrument
A,Sharp instrument
C,Yes a sharp instrument like that of a parang
A,And there is the fifth injury on the report which is the fatal stab wound
A,Fifth injury fatal stab wound triangular stab wound left anterolateral mid-chest wall
A,Where can we find this
C,P twenty-eight and thirty-one
B,Let's look at it
A,Twenty-eight shows about three stab wounds
A,Which of these
C,The one nearest the left nipple
A,Would your Lordship want Doctor Wee to mark the injury
B,No
B,Near the nipple we can see that
A,Yes
A,And the same injury can also be seen my Lord in P
B,Thirty-one
A,Yes
A,It is also near the left nipple
B,Compared to the other injuries so far seen looking at the photograph it doesn't seem to be a very serious one
B,But I suppose Doctor Wee is going to explain to us
C,Yes
A,Could you describe to us the wound and tell us why it is the fatal wound
C,This is a triangular stab wound
C,It penetrated the full thickness of the chest wall
C,It went into the right side of the heart
C,Because there was penetration into the heart I considered that this wound was the fatal wound
A,The most serious of
C,The most serious of the rest
A,Now this wound Doctor Wee would be consistent with
B,How would you say this wound had been caused
A,Yes
A,With what instrument would this wound be caused
C,It's caused by a sharp instrument which is triangular on cross-section
A,Sharp Doctor Wee means pointed as opposed to the sharpness of a parang
A,The edges of a parang
C,Yes
A,It is a pointed instrument
A,Yes
A,Sharp pointed instrument
B,What he means is it's a pointed instrument
C,A pointed
A,Sharp in that
B,A pointed instrument
B,Can you give us some examples
C,Pointed tip like a bearing scraper
B,Anything else
C,Any other sharp instrument that is triangular on cross-section
B,Can you explain the expression triangular on cross-section
C,The blade if one were across and look at it it should be triangular
B,It is a cross-section
C,Yes
B,Taking a cross-section of it and when we look at it it is triangular in shape
C,Yes
B,So it could be something like a
C,Bearing scraper
A,A metal file
A,A sharp metal file with a pointed tip which is triangular in shape would that
C,Yes it would
A,Would that instrument be consistent with the wound caused by such an instrument
B,A metal
B,What did you say Mister
A,A sharp pointed metal file with a triangular shape
B,Metal file
A,With a triangular cross-section
B,No no
B,Leave the cross-section alone
C,Moderate force
A,Moderate force was used
A,You need only a moderate force to penetrate with this type of instrument
C,Yes
A,And while we are still at this injury perhaps you can tell us from your observation
A,Would an assailant who uses this instrument would he be
A,Which position would he be vis-a-vis the deceased
A,Would you be able to tell us looking at the wound and the track
C,Most likely to be a frontal
B,Frontal attack
A,Frontal attack yes
A,We go on to the next wound Doctor Wee
A,Before I go to the next wound this wound and the four other wounds which you have just described
A,Would you say that they are caused by different instruments
C,Yes
A,It cannot be the same instrument
C,No
A,Definitely a different instrument
C,Yes
B,It was not a parang anyway
C,No
B,This fifth wound was not caused by a parang
C,No
C,Could not have been
B,That explains the difference in the wounds as shown in the photographs
C,Yes
A,Wound number six
A,This is also another stab wound
A,Right anterolateral mid chest wall
A,Where can you find
B,Before you go to the sixth wound Mister Seng
B,Can you ask him some questions on or would you be coming back to it later as to the cause of death
A,I will go through the wounds first and then
B,All right
B,Very well
A,So that we have an idea of what the wounds are before
B,Very well
B,And because the witness said that is a fatal wound we will come back to that later
A,I'll be asking him about the other wound as well
B,Now you are on the sixth wound
B,Yes where is it to be found
A,Where can you find the sixth wound Doctor Wee
C,Sorry the picture is not very clear
C,It is at the side of P thirty-one
A,It is very hard to see
A,Perhaps you could mark the or show his Lordship where the wound is
A,Circle it and mark number six
B,Yes
B,That is the sixth wound P thirty-one
A,And would you say that this wound could be caused by the same instrument or similar instrument that has caused the fifth wound
C,Yes
A,Consistent with the triangular sharp instrument
C,Yes
B,Not a parang
C,No
A,Now the seventh wound which is a slash wound number seven
A,Where can you find this wound in the photographs
C,P thirty-two
A,There are two
A,The one nearer the neck
C,Yes
A,There are two wounds
A,Two very clear wounds
B,Yes nearer the armpit
A,Yes the one near the armpit
B,The bigger of the two wounds shown on the photograph
A,Yes
A,And this would he consistent with that caused by a parang
C,Yes a parang
A,Slashed caused by a parang
A,And the eighth slash wound
C,It is the one below the
A,Seventh wound
C,Yes
A,That is also consistent with that caused by a sharp object like a parang
C,Yes
C,Like a parang
A,The ninth wound is a stab wound at the abdomen
A,Which photograph would that be
C,P twenty-eight
A,There are three there
C,The one nearest the navel
A,The one in the centre yes
A,Has your Lordship got it
B,Yes
A,That is the ninth stab
B,Yes
B,The other one is of course the fatal wound isn't it
A,That is at the nipple
A,Yes
A,Doctor Wee my first question is taking the injuries as a whole all the injuries
A,If the deceased had been rushed to hospital immediately would he likely have been saved
C,No
A,Any possibility
B,What time frame are you speaking about Mr Tan
A,Immediately after he sustained the injuries my Lord
B,I know
B,Immediately means within two minutes or ten minutes or what
A,Within ten minutes if he had been rushed to the hospital
C,Not likely
A,Is it a question of degree or is it simply improbable to save his life
C,Improbable
A,And even if you are given half a day to treat him
A,Would you be able to save his life
B,Sorry
B,I didn't hear the question
A,If a team of doctors are given half a day to treat his injuries would his life be saved
C,Unlikely
B,You see the Doctor has already said if he was rushed to hospital within ten minutes he was unlikely to be saved
B,How could a team of doctors for half a day do anything better
A,Yes
B,Carry on
A,I read in the report Doctor Wee the time of death was at zero zero forty-eight minutes
B,After midnight
B,Forty-eight minutes after midnight
C,Yes
A,Doctor Wee could you tell the Court
B,When did the ambulance arrive Mister Tan
B,Just to follow your line of cross-examination
A,The ambulance arrived at about
B,I think the ambulance arrived fairly quickly isn't it from the call
A,About nine minutes
A,About ten minutes later he was sent to the hospital
B,That is right
B,That is my recollection
A,Yes my Lord
A,What I want to confirm is the time of death Doctor Wee
A,Where did you get the information from
C,This information was given to us on the police three zero three report
A,And the medical officer in charge at the hospital must have
C,Certified death
A,Now do you have a copy of that certification here
C,No
