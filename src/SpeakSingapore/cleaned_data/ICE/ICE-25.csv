B,Then I asked him about pricing lah
A,Uhm
B,Supposing you know if it is open air uh it would be nice to have live music right
A,Uhm
B,Musicians and all that playing uh
A,Uhm
B,So if you have live musicians uh then the cost would go up
A,Uhm ya
B,and if you've taped music of course it would be very cheap nuh
A,Not nice ya
B,But won't be nice
B,So I thought you know taped music won't be so effective
B,Anyway I've told them the cost but they never came back to me
A,It's probably too expensive
B,Probably too expensive
A,Ya I wonder how much they pay all these charge <unclear> word </unclear>
B,And then I I told them you know they could even have the China people perform right
A,Ya ya
B,For example 'lan ma' uh
A,The guests
B,uh guests

B,Kiddies
A,Ya
B,Ha
A,But mostly very young lah
B,Huh Kiddies
A,Ya
B,They won't appreciate
A,That's why
B,some of the things
A,That's why
B,Ya
A,Then some of the plays <unclear> word </unclear>
A,Some of the plays are marked with an asterisk
B,Ah
A,Then they say These plays contain strong language and adult abuse
A,So to warn you lah
A,Don't bring your children to watch these kinds of stuff
B,<O> laughs </O>

A,Ya
B,Some are like that
A,Ya
B,I see
B,How long it'll last uh
B,One month
B,Three weeks or what
A,The third what fourteen or something <unclear> word </unclear>
B,But it clashes with the Film Fes isn't it
A,Ya everything clashes with Film Fes
A,Ya ya everything clashes with Film Fes lor
A,Then just before Film Fes
B,Uhm
A,at that European Community Film Fes
B,Oh
A,Ya
B,But that was before the Film Fes so it's not so bad you see
A,Ya ya but then it's like you know
B,Too close
A,Ya
A,Then you got to spend so much money
B,uhm and so much time
B,Uhm
A,Ya
B,Is that Film Fes is still on uh
A,Yep until next Sunday
B,Oh so it really clashes uh
A,Uhm
B,I don't know why they don't space it out properly uh
A,Ya don't know lah
B,Uhm
A,There's a lot of explanations and and all that
A,Then June got Arts Fes
B,Ya June got Arts Fes so whoa this year full of fes
B,Tiring lah hor
A,Ya sometimes
A,Okay lah
A,I mean it's probably the same crowd who go to film fes and arts fes <X>
B,Ya the same people what A lot of yuppies also go to this
A,And it's amazing you know The shows uh most of the films are I think sold out you know
B,Uhm uhm
A,Ya
B,But Film Fes usually like that
A,Ya
B,You find it hard to guide <&>  get </&> get tickets
A,Ya but then then it's like you know the rest of the year we don't have very good stuff in the local cinemas
B,Uhm
A,Then but then when the Film Fes comes around people snap up the tickets So that means there is a market for for this kind of more unusual films
B,Not really you know I mean because there's a film fes sort of people know that these things are on If you space it out and you put it on the commercial market nuh
A,Uhm uhm
B,then you may miss it you know
A,Market you then you must publicize it market it <unclear> word </unclear>
B,And then the commercial market uh for this type of film uh it won't last long you see Couple of days uh Then by the time you get to know about it it's off right
A,Ya That's why they they don't publicize their stuff properly especially Cathay
B,Whereas in the Film Fes it's all concentrated
A,Ya and they have publicity whereas like you know a lot of commercial cinemas they don't publicize their films So couple of good films come to Cathay you know
B,Uhm
A,go to Picture House or whatever
B,and then you miss
A,they're not publicized at all There's no write-up about them You know nothing about them Three days later they're gone
B,Uhm
A,So I figured it out Cathay's tac tactic is uh they bring in the big films right
B,Uhm
A,and then in between the big films they throw in filler movies
B,Uhm
A,and I think that sometimes the filler movies are worth watching People would go and watch if only you promote the movies I think you can earn even more money
B,But maybe they think it's too much money to spend on advertisements Ya
A,Ya But it's it's such a waste you know
B,Ya
