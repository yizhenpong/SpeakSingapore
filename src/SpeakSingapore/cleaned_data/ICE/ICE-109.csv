A,Good morning I hope you don't mind my starting now but we have quite a lot of materials to get through today alright
A,Our last lecture on vicarious liability
A,So let's continue there
A,Now last week yah I was starting to go through some of the rules by <unclear> word </unclear> when an act of an employee is done within the force of employment
A,As I said the phrase force of employment is used rather likely used in the phrase
A,You take care and a lot of things <unclear> word </unclear> yah
A,As far as I carry the liability of return this phrase indicates when policy would tend to make an employer liable to the act of an employee right
A,So first we have to define what the employee's duties are that's logically first step in the analysis
A,The next thing is to try to find the connection between what the employee has done and tort to his people complain of and the employer because at the end of the day we want to make the employer liable right
A,Now after talking a little bit about connection I went into some situation because as I say it is the the convention is divide the acts of employees into two basic types careless acts by the employee
A,In other words where the tort arises from a careless act of the employee and deliberate act when the tort was committed deliberately alright
A,Because then show differentiation in these two categories is necessary because it much easier to say that the employer is liable where the tort was merely committed carelessly where the tort was committed deliberately by the employee then the employer has far better chance of escaping liability right
A,That's the conventional classification and I've already talked about careless acts by the employee right
A,Now I'm introducing another category category which I think is useful for our analysis because really there are acts which fall in between the class careless act by the employee leading to the tort and when we talk about careless act here we're talking about careless act within the normal duties of the employee right
A,And then there are deliberate tort deliberate tort committed by the employee for which the employer doesn't tend to be liable
A,There is what I call intermediate position and the terminology is my own
A,This intermediate position has elements of both right
A,Where we have intermediate position like this we're already talking about an employee who has deliberately done what he's not supposed to do as far as his employer's concerned
A,He departed from his usual duties deliberately but the tort arises out of his carelessness right
A,So different from deliberate tort by the employee because the employee did not actually intend to cause harm right
A,It's different from deliberate tort which we're going to discuss in a while
A,It's deliberate from the pure careless tort which I was discussing earlier because here the employee isn't so much acting within his normal duty
A,He has done something that's a little bit different from what the employee sorry what the employer really intended him to do right
A,This intermediate position it doesn't fall nicely into either classification and so I think we can usefully discuss it separately
A,Now I <unclear> word </unclear> there were blank looks last week when I'm was making that point sorry last Tuesday so let's just take an example of what I consider to be intermediate position right
A,A case which should be familiar to you right now from our lectures on Richard on sat Richard statutory duty ICI Chapel right
A,You remember in that case <unclear> word </unclear> was supposed to follow certain procedures
A,They were supposed to follow certain procedures when setting off explosives or sorry when testing connection and things like that
A,They decided not to follow these procedures yah and there was an explosion an injury was sustained
A,Now the injury was not deliberately caused right
A,Nobody actually set out to hurt anybody but there was a deliberate departure on the part of the employees from what they were supposed to do
A,They were supposed to test the connection in a certain way they decided not to do it
A,They decided to do it in a way which they were told not to do it right
A,So this is an illustration of what I call the intermediate position
A,The harm is not caused deliberately but it flows because the employee has deliberately departed from what should be his proper duty
A,Another example of that would be <unclear> word </unclear> also a breach of statutory duty <unclear> word </unclear>
A,Look that up yourself
A,These cases I think you will recall resulted in the employee sorry in the employer not being vicariously liable right
A,There was vicarious the employer's <unclear> word </unclear> vicarious liability there which should be indicate to you that this really can be treated differently from the pure careless act
A,It's very difficult for the employer to escape vicarious liability for a pure careless act occurring as a result of the employee performing his duties properly if carelessly
A,But in this intermediate position it is slightly easier for the employer to escape vicarious liability
A,Examples of where the another example of where the employer escapes vicarious liability would be for instance the case of Storey and Ashton right
A,This is the case that would be in most of the case books so I'll leave you to look it up yourself except that I'd like you to note that here it involves someone who has finished his duties he had completed his duties in other words and what he did was he took a ride yah he took a ride after that to visit someone
A,It was a personal visit using his employee's carriage
A,While on the way for this personal visit he got into an accident
A,Someone was injured
A,So was the employer vicariously liable for his carelessness here
A,The answer was no
A,The employee's duties had ended right
A,The court used the phrase that ah that employee had gone on a frolic of his own
A,This word <unclear> word </unclear> sample phrases that I'm confident will end up in your vocabulary before very long
A,Just like phrases like floodgates of liability and very often been misused
A,But that really is a phrase which gets used from time to time when we're talking about the employee's duties yah
A,The stage he has departed from his duties in a manner sufficient to spare the employer liable
A,We often use the phrase the employee went on a frolic of his own
A,That indicates the connection with the employment it's not sufficient to found vicarious liability right
A,As I said the test in these kinds of situation would be whether or not tortious conduct the accident while travelling with your friend yah is reasonably incidental to the performance of your duties
A,In Storey and Ashton it's pretty clear that it wasn't reasonably incidental because the employee had finished doing what he was supposed to do
A,He had finished making all deliveries so there was an insufficient connection there
A,But no not all departures from duties will amount to a frolic
A,An example of a case where it wasn't frolic it's Whatman and Pearson which was mentioned earlier
A,This is a case where an employee was told not to go home for lunch uh and leave some <unclear> word </unclear> unattended the employee did so
A,The horses ran ran wild caused some injury and the employer was held vicariously liable for those injuries even though he <unclear> word </unclear> from the deliberate departure by the employee from what he was told to do
A,That what I call the intermediate position as I said it lies between deliberate acts and careless acts Careless acts very hard for the employer to escape vicarious liability
A,Deliberate acts more easy for the employer to escape vicarious liability
A,An example of a deliberate tort by the employee yah for which the employer was not held liable would be a local case that went up to the Privy Council Keppel Bus Company and Sa'ad Bin Ahmad
A,This is an this is a case from Singapore I I don't think many of you are old enough to remember there was a Keppel Bus Company but this case really is a stuff which New Paper headlines are made
A,Conductor attacks passenger
A,That's what happened
A,The conductor was one of those that fortunately we don't have anymore yah uhm he was he was abusing a passenger
A,The plaintiff like a hero went up and tried to tick the conductor off and got a ticket punched in his eye
A,Now this case is really a very good advertisement for OMO
A,Uhm the plaintiff lost his eye as a result of this assault and he sued the employer right
A,As I said there would have been no point in this case trying to sue the employer
A,This is a mere bus conductor who would have been earning two three hundred dollars a month yah
A,How's he going to make good the loss of the eye
A,Answer he can't
A,So the plaintiff tried suing the employer Keppel Bus Company and what was decided in that case
A,Answer the employee's conduct was deliberate wrongdoing by the employee
A,It was deliberate wrongdoing so the employer should not be vicariously liable
A,Now another example of a situation where deliberate conduct spares the employer vicarious liability deliberate tort yah would spare the employer vicarious liability
A,It's a fairly similar case Warren and Henley
A,This time in England
A,A garage station attendant who gets a strange idea in his head and starts accusing a passenger of non-payment sorry uh a customer of not paying his bill
A,Customer gets upset says some things to the to the attendant
A,Attendant flies into a rage and hits the pa the customer
A,Now again the court said the employer was not liable because this was an assault
A,It was pure vengeance on the part of the employee
A,It's not connected with employment
A,It's deliberate act and therefore the deliberateness of the assault severed the connection with his employment even though he did it during office hours yah even though he did it because he was in that position because he was employed by the by the employer there was still not sufficient con uh connection
A,The deliberateness severed the connection that's necessary to make the employer liable for the tort
A,It would be nice if we could say the uh the employer was never liable for deliberate act but I'm afraid life is not so simple because there are deliberate acts where employers still are liable for the torts right
A,One example is Poland and John Parr
A,This is a case again on assault where the employee saw the plaintiff and thought the plaintiff was trying to steal the employer's goodies from all the carriage
A,So the employee gave the plaintiff a good hard knock
A,The plaintiff fell down under the wheels of the carriage and had his arm broken right
A,Uhm in that case however the court said the employer was vicariously liable
A,So even though it was a deliberate assault on the part of the employee
A,The employer was still vicariously liable
A,In other words deliberate conduct doesn't always severed the connection between the tort and the employer
A,There may be vicarious liability So when will there be vicarious liability a deliberate conduct and when will the employer escape
A,I think the answer lies in looking at the nature of the conduct and whether or not there is benefit to the employer from that conduct right
A,Now when we talk about conduct again I would avoid defining conduct too narrowly
A,We're not talking about whether or not the employer benefited from the blow being struck by the employee in Poland and Paar right
A,We're talking about whether the employee thought he was something for the benefit of the employer in other words guarding the goods right
A,Compare that for instance the Keppel Bus Company and Sa'ad Bin Ahmad and Warren and Henley right <X>
