A,I don't think there has been a let down in fact uh I would disagree with your starting point
A,First of all you must understand that Chinese New Year rally is not just during Chinese New Year
A,Statistically it it shows in the last fifteen years using discriminate analysis it's actually four weeks before Chinese New Year and two weeks after and of course as they say there are uh lies damn lies to statistics and in this case it means that the definitions of those uhm weeks are not absolutely precise and if we look just before Christmas there was actually a very strong rally from the thirteen hundred level up so in fact we have an early ang pow in this respect
A,Well I would start taking uhm or counting my chickens at that point and perhaps start taking some profit
B,I think there is no such thing as a clear precise way of looking at the market though one thing that has been established is what's known as the Capricorn effect that during the month of January stock prices have gone up and that's the case here
B,I think the volume has been a lot lower than in previous years and in part we are driven by a lot of uncertainty on the one side and that's the most bullish factor interest rates are down
B,In Singapore I think many people are wondering what to do with the money next
B,You know you don't get a real return if you if you leave your money in a deposit with the bank right now
B,Internationally the problem is that you know people are waiting for corporate earnings to grow again
B,I think yes it would but I think the problem is this we're in a situation now where the world seems to be entreating rangers
B,The bottom I think has been established we hope to see short of a very major political shock I think so unlikely that there will be a huge drop in markets anywhere in the world
B,What we are having a problem is is establishing how much into our <unclear> word </unclear>
B,The demand side isn't as good as the fact that cost are dropping therefore by virtue of that earnings in various companies should gradually continue to improve
A,I don't think the market has ignored them again I I must beg to differ you must remember that during this period Tokyo has gone on a free fall for sometime and the fact that the Singapore market has been able to hold up so very well during this period given the very close correlation between these two indices I think it's indicative of the fact that there is strong buying out there
A,Uhm I I totally agree in this instance that there is beginning to have less uh investment opportunities but I disagree in the sense that I see nineteen ninety-one as a transition year between a poor economy to a good economy in ninety-three
A,But a year in which liquidity is going to grow but where the real economy is unable to demand that money and there are basically only three opportunities bonds uhm stocks or commodities or cash I guess will be the other one
A,But uh as we said interest rates are falling as you've gotten your uh uh programme commodities are not particularly looking and that's very speculative and I think there's going to be more and more driving back into the equity markets
A,Actually the cautiousness of the market today is I think are considered very bullish factor because when it's when it turns around to become more positive uhm people are going stop buying
B,At present uh levels in the market what we'll see is fair value
B,If you look at historical factors comparing internationally the Singapore markets' P E is the same as the US market P E
B,Traditionally Singapore market P E is rated higher we don't have the problems of the US so obviously what people are expecting is that the US market will really turn out quite strongly after some consolidation
B,If that happens then that will be a kick for the Singapore market
B,Now which sectors are looking good I think the construction sector which in the previous years has a very rough times is going to look very interesting this time
A,I don't think investors can I think investors have to take a decision whether or not we are in this transition period
A,If they are they should either uhm go in heavily in the blue-chips and expect to ride it up both the ups and the down
A,Alternatively they have to trade it
A,The second is a much more speculative approach
A,However if we are right that this year is going to be a vintage year for Singapore then it's a question of timing rather than of risk
B,I feel the cursory investor can hatch some of his bet
B,There are around a few shares less than a handful in the market where the yield is actually better than the interest rate today
B,I think if you buy those shares you won't go very far wrong
B,Number two I think in Malaysia now some shares have dropped so much that they are offering very good two to three year type values
B,If you're looking at that go right it
B,The most conservative investor would keep some or quite a lot of money in some form of bond or cash and keep a small portion for trading in the market and this would be stocks lower-priced stocks and warrants </I>
C,In my uh speech in parliament that you have referred to I used a very simple example comparing prices twenty years ago <unclear> word </unclear> and I show that in terms of basic commodity basic prices like food the purchasing power of Singaporeans has more than able to keep pace uh with the inflation
C,On the other hand in terms of big-ticket items like cars and a nicer home I think the price increase has in fact out-paced uh the purchasing power
C,And increasingly for the younger and better educated Singaporeans those affordability of big-ticket items are in fact being used by them to gauge the standard of living they are enjoying
C,In that sense yes
C,Well I think the CPI is a very blunt instrument in the sense that it uh collated all the statistical data of some many consumers they are probably one point over million consumer in Singapore into one single digit
C,So as such I don't think we can really count on CPI to reflect the actual cost of giving increases for every Singaporean
D,Well I think uh the CPI is a measure of average change change of prices so uh the the problem of course is the CPI is the most uh obvious indicator of price changes
D,It is not the only uh indictor of price changes there are several others use by economist and so on
D,But yes so far as the CPI is concern uh I think it is worth noting that the individual component which make up the CPI are release by the Department of Statistics and if we feel that the consumption pattern is somewhat different it is uh quite possible for us to reconstruct our own price-index
D,For instance uh a personal CPI something that would show my own change in the uh my own change in the cost of living personally experience by me
D,Uh this has been done for the expatriate community the Singapore International Chamber of Commerce has constructed that
D,So several price indices of several CPI could actually be constructed I think in Hong Kong they they actually publish a a several CPI three or four types of CPI
E,Well there's one that normally that stands out when you compare Singapore CPI with say uh CPS in the region and that is that although we are much more developed country the way that we get the food is substantially higher than that of say Indonesia uh which has about thirty-four per cent rate compared to Singapore's forty per cent or Malaysia thirty-six per cent gain
E,Yes one would expect Singapore as a more developed country to have a smaller proportion of its con consumption basket weighted to its food
E,Maybe as an explanation for that in amount the amount of cooked food that Singaporeans eat but certainly that is one thing that stands out when someone observes the CPI
E,Well the point is the CPI is that measure an enriched price level and I think these product changes and all that really come in at the fringes affecting maybe point seven or point eight per cent of of the weights used in the index
E,So I don't think it de detracts from the CPI measuring the average price level
C,I have a point that Dr Soon mention that in Hong Kong there are different category of CPI so would you say that in Singapore perhaps we can partition the consumer into their income levels and since in Singapore most people staying in HDB flats
C,Perhaps we can look at the three- room flats and below the four-room five-room and executive and private and construct a CPI
D,Well consumption is possible to do that and I think practically is also possible so long as so long as we have the individual components
D,But I think we mustn't lose track of the fact that the CPI is designed to be a measure of average price increases
D,So in that respect if you if you look if you track the movement of the CPI with the GDP deflator which is often used to deflate the Gross Domestic Product to get the real economic growth uh you find that the CPI and the GDP deflator in Singapore has been moving fairly closely together
D,In other words they show fairly similar trends the same with uh other price deflators such as personal consumption expenditure price deflator
D,So so as a measure of average change in price the CPI is perhaps a fairly decent indicator but when it comes to an individual or to a particular segment of the population it is not so good because it's quite academic to me that the CPI doesn't go up by by say it goes up by only three per cent but the cost of petrol goes up or the cost of car goes up and I'm in the market for car
D,So that to me maybe what is affecting my own perception of my well-being
E,Well the CPI and inflation derived from there is important in wage negotiations it's important in formulating policies
E,So certainly true those mechanisms through wages through policy responses to inflation one could have quite a decisive impact on the economy
E,For instance my people assume that uh uh the government here uses the exchange rate as an instrument to control inflation so whenever inflation show signs of accelerating one assumes that the government will allow the Singapore dollar to appreciate and that's going to have an impact on our competitiveness and so on
E,So obviously it can have a major impact on the economy
D,Well I think I would I would uh I would along with that
D,I think we we must be quite careful with uh with in an indiscriminate uh criticism of the CPI and say that because the CPI doesn't answer this particular question it doesn't address this particular issue therefore there's something wrong with the CPI because if we talk about economic indicators we can only use indicators which are design for the purpose for which it is uh to design to meet the purpose for which it is design
D,So for instance if we are interested in the problems or the impact on the poor therefore we would go about to construct a price index on the on the changes in the price of various commodities on how they would affect poo uh the the poor the living standard of the poor and so on and so forth <X>
D,So there there could be a whole range of economic indictors that one could decide So we must be very careful and say that because it doesn't meet its purpose therefore we try to do away with it
