B,And uh this this uh just think I I need another month's time I can get a
B,We should get a letter to go and sign on the legal documents uh
B,But my problem now is this old man who bought over my house
B,He wants to come in and start planning the renovation while I'm still there
A,Old man uh
A,Days are numbered
B,That might be create quite a problem uh because of my house now a lot of junk
A,Uhm did
B,We've got boxes lying around then my antiques
A,Why don't you just show him the plan
B,I don't have a plan my friend
B,You know the plan uh

A,You ask him
A,See how much
A,Five five dollars per copy
B,Ever since I moved in ever since I ever since I moved in I never paid I never bought the plan
B,But in this new house that I bought the owner bought a plan and gave me a copy
A,But I thought when I got my flat they gave me free
B,Ha
A,I I didn't pay for it
A,I didn't buy a plan
A,They just gave me a a plan of my flat
B,Are you sure
A,Ya
B,Nowadays you got to buy you know
A,Really uh
B,How old is your flat
A,About six years
B,Ah about the same time same as mine what
A,Six years exactly uh
A,But mine all included with the sales agreement
A,I don't think my wife paid for it
A,I didn't pay
B,Maybe it's all in all added up into the sum you pay
B,You don't know
A,Maybe lah maybe
B,Uh
A,You can ask him to buy lah
A,You pay
A,How much can it cost
B,Not much lah
A,Search fee maybe two dollars about ten dollars uh
B,Not much lah
B,But but it's a way of making money what
A,Ah
A,Just I just came back from HDB
C,Pastor Wee
B,Ya
C,Uh just <unclear> word </unclear> can you come to the phone for a while
B,Uh just a minute uh
B,Is it urgent or not
C,Urgent yes
B,Okay
B,Were you around at the Peter Lewis seminar
A,No
A,I was yesterday
A,I missed service Sunday service uh
B,Uh
A,How was the seminar
B,I I think for the night meetings uh about two hundred plus
A,Two hundred plus uh
B,Two hundred twenty thirty
B,I expected more uh
A,Uhm
B,But
A,Were these people church members or outside
B,Most of them were church members
B,But I I I I'm beginning to see uhm maybe we we need to we need to we need to strategize the publicity
B,Remember two two two years ago your missions conference was goyak
A,No
A,Mission conference was okay
B,Two years ago
B,Remember when uh Terence was organising it
A,Oh when I was still a student
B,Attendance
A,Put the record straight
A,I was a student not working yet
B,The attendance was terrible
B,Remember only about a few people turned up
B,And that unless unless you push hard uh people will not come
B,Uh uh we were just talking about it last night with uh Danny and uh my wife and Philip
A,Uhm uhm
B,It's it's information overkill
B,They look up the bulletin on Sunday
A,There're too many
B,Too many things
A,Too many
B,It's information overload
B,The system breakdown
B,They don't know how to prioritize
A,Uhm
B,Which one to attend which one not to attend
A,Uhm
B,So in the end they glaze over everything and nothing seems in
A,That's probably just one one factor
A,I think the other point you need to see is the period in which you began your publicity
B,Long time ago you know
A,Long time
A,When when when was long time ago
B,I wrote a letter to all the the Small Group Leaders you know
B,About one and a half months ago
A,But you you didn't have prayer meeting calling the Small Group Leaders to pray
B,No
A,Which we did
A,Our mission conference preparation took about a year
A,It's just the preparation and then we have our quarterly uh mission prayer night
A,And we made it a point to emphasize to point out this mission conference
B,I suppose the other the other thing is how you sell how you sell the publicity
A,Uhm
B,Put the topic like that
B,You'll deter a lot of people from coming
A,Ya ya
B,Only those who are really interested come
A,The the the topic itself tells you what is expected uh
B,Ya
A,Spiritual movement
A,Not everybody wants <unclear> word </unclear>
B,Not everybody wants discipleship too
B,It's it scares people away the topic
A,Ya discipleship <unclear> word </unclear>
B,You can <unclear> word </unclear> with missions what
B,When you organize a missions conference people interested in <unclear> word </unclear>
B,Those not interested won't come
B,So in the but I I think on the whole those who came really benefited
A,They were Small Group Leaders
B,Most of them
B,But I there were a lot more Small Group Leaders who didn't turn up
A,Uhm
B,Somehow they <unclear> word </unclear> that's good
A,Ya
B,Well I I think uh uh he's a good fellow to fall back for something <unclear> word </unclear> conference uh
B,Talking about a Bible conference Sunday School <unclear> word </unclear> seminar or something of that sort
B,'Cos his exposition is quite good
B,That's supposed to be his specialty
A,What's his background
B,Baptist
A,Evangelical Baptist
B,Yes
B,But he preached at uh he was a good friend of Martin Lloyd Jones
A,Really
B,Martin Lloyd Jones got him to preach <unclear> word </unclear>
A,So did
A,Oh really so uh
B,So his style of preaching is Martin Lloyd Jones'
A,Uhm
B,You read Martin Lloyd Jones books and listen to his tapes and uh the style is about the same
B,But I when I was sitting down talking to him I I think right now he might be coming back here quite often because he's made contacts with uh Church of Singapore
B,He's made contacts with uh Anglican church
A,Oh is it
B,And I think his own church in UK is finally releasing him
A,Uhm
B,To go on this kind of tours
B,So if you want to you can call him again
A,Maybe family camp will be good
A,If they talk about Wesley Wesley camp pointing or focused on activities
A,This time perhaps focus on Bible study <unclear> word </unclear>
B,If we have if we have a Bible conference <unclear> word </unclear>
B,But uh I think next year will be a different conference inviting somebody else
B,Whole flavour will change
A,Maybe we just have too many conferences
B,That's
A,<unclear> word </unclear>
B,That's another possibility lah
B,We have we have too many programs in town
A,Uh uh
B,People have to choose
B,So it's overload overkill
A,Ya
B,Uh don't know lah
B,I hope I I'm I'm glad that I have finished this project
A,So this one of your projects
B,For this year
B,So now I'm looking forward to moving house again

A,If you go to supermarket also it'll be very expensive
B,Ya when I took Peter and Valerie out yesterday afternoon for lunch they said that's very very something they seldom do over there <X>
A,Uh
B,Because for them to to eat out it's <unclear> word </unclear> ten times more than cooking at home
B,So for them after church uh it's usually
A,<unclear> word </unclear>
B,Lunch means we take you home for lunch
