,<I> <X>
X,
A,Ya ya it's moving
B,It's moving
A,Okay you can start presenting
B,<unclear> word </unclear> Let me collect my thoughts okay
A,Uh maybe I maybe I
B,Ya
A,Would just run through a bit about the background lah
B,Uhm
A,Uh
B,Ya ya
A,Essentially
B,Okay lah
A,I've some coverage
B,Uhm
A,Right uhm and I have been approached several time by different people about uh
B,Uhm
A,The fact that the coverage is not sufficient you see
B,Uhm
A,Uh and and things like that
B,Uhm
A,And I've also seen the several uh uh advertisement on the papers
B,Uhm
A,plus also mails lah
B,Uhm
A,that talk about uh that focuses on uhm low premium but uh having uh
B,Uhm
A,<unclear> word </unclear> is it
B,Uhm
A,Uh so I'm a bit curious as to uh what what does this offer versus the normal type of uh insurance coverage you see
A,Uhm seems like to me that uh this type uh gives protection
B,Uhm
A,Uh but uh it's not something that's for saving versus the life type that is both uh
B,Uhm
A,Coverage protecting protection and also saving lah
B,Yep
A,That that seems to be the difference to me
B,So that's the main diff but
A,Ya
B,Can I find out what you've got now
A,Uh okay I've got uh I've got uh I think I've I've got two GEs
B,Uhm
A,which which covers uh I think it's about two hundred plus K or thereabout
B,Are they all totally savings or <unclear> word </unclear> saving
A,One is endowment and the other one is life
B,<unclear> word </unclear> All hundred percent
A,What is hundred percent
B,That means there is no uhm no protection only insurance coupled into the program
A,There are some riders
B,Ah
A,I I don't know what whether you call them
B,Ya ya sure ya most of these riders would tend to just increase the cover without increasing the savings
A,Ya ya
B,Huh
A,They are riders yes
B,They they they're sort of uh composite lah
A,But they're I don't have uh rider alone type if if you if you see what I'm talking about
B,Uhm how old are they
A,Just about maybe about two years I think
B,You mean you took them together one after the other
A,They uh sort of almost lah
B,Two years old lah
A,Uhm uhm
B,Okay so that's an endowment
A,What is the typical uh range of coverage normally for most most most people
B,It actually ties in to how much you want to put aside
A,Uhm
B,How much you want to cater if you go off suddenly
A,Uhm
B,uhm what are your outstanding
A,Uhm
B,you know uhm that you'll things that you have to provide for
A,so <unclear> word </unclear>
B,Ya I mean you one-room flat kind of dweller
B,It's more than sufficient income
A,Uhm
B,If you have you know great visions for your sons and <unclear> word </unclear> them for post-graduate or whatever
A,Uhm
B,You know you will have to <unclear> word </unclear> for more lah
A,Okay okay
B,Uhm which which are the adverts you like
A,I think there was the latest one I receive is uh CIGNA
B,Ah CIGNA ya
A,Uhm
B,Credit card one
A,Ya so that one is actually I think it's like uh you you every month you pay about twenty thirty dollars or something like that and the cover for fifty K or hundred K
A,Uhm they've I think sometime ago there was one that talk about uh that that came from uh uhm the one that's associated with NTUC I think uh
B,INCOME
A,it it's not INCOME but there there there's another one that
B,There is another one
A,uhm can't remember the name
B,ICS
A,Huh
B,ICS
A,Ya ya ya I think it's ICS uh
A,That that was on the papers
B,Ya
A,But several of these uh credit card ones also uh provide uh this type of uh uh protection only type of uh coverage
B,From the protection only insurance you want know about it or are you in the position to say Yes I think I need more insurance but I want to get maximum protection for minimum amount only
A,Uhm
B,What's your state of mind right now
A,Uh I'm just trying to explore uh what are the various offerings uh in terms of protection only
B,Uhm
A,and and then maybe make an assessment whether I can afford or I can't afford
B,Ah okay let me just run through quickly
A,Uhm
B,Uhm they come in many names lah okay
A,Oh
B,Basically there're of a temporary nature
A,Uhm
B,Have you got time
A,No no no I've I've enough time
B,Uhm okay and that's twenty minutes <unclear> word </unclear>
A,Ya
B,So you get of a temporary
A,The tension is released after that huh
B,Ya can disclose more confidential information
B,Okay it's of a temporary nature uhm
B,The ones which the credit cards normally offer are yearly renewable
A,Oh okay what does that mean
B,It's goes year by year uhm
A,and it's subject to the company renewing it
B,Ya
A,Oh
B,It it it possibly uhm normally the structure would be the premium will be stepped
B,That means
A,Is it
B,with
A,I thought from the
B,From this age group to this age group is this price
A,Oh okay
B,Okay
B,Uhm and I think over and above sixty or sixty five
B,They don't want to insure you any more
A,Oh okay
B,Okay uhm and sometimes they've already <unclear> word </unclear> in this they might do an average
A,Uhm
B,Okay
A,Uhm
B,But it it's it's generally either one or the other lah
A,Uhm
B,Okay
B,Uhm it's the main difference is whether you want to ensure that it does its job or not
A,Uhm
B,or do you want to only insure for x number of years and are happy that it runs out
A,Uhm
B,Okay
A,Right
B,That that as far as I'm concerned my my responsibility to my family is only until I'm fifty by after which anything happens to me you guys are on your own something like that
A,Ya
B,It it's it's how you look at it
A,Okay
B,If you're looking at cash at or or okay providing cash and there there's an end-point of time then you would rule this out because you don't have any temporary type insurances which last your whole life long
B,It will definitely expire
A,This this one uh
B,Uhm ya
B,Their low premium <unclear> word </unclear>
A,Anyway it doesn't it doesn't give you cash right
B,It doesn't
B,There's no savings
A,Uh ya ya it's just protection
B,Ya
A,It's it's money gone once you pay up
B,Ya it's it's like a car insurance <unclear> word </unclear>
A,Right right
B,no accident okay
A,Okay
B,Okay
B,Uhm I think sometimes they calculate with an accident insurance and they bundle it all together uhm
A,What do you mean by that
A,Accident accident
B,Are you familiar with personal accident insurances
A,Uh no no
B,Uh it pays if you have an accident and you you don't survive you get disabled
A,Uhm
B,Loose limbs fingers <unclear> word </unclear>
A,Oh oh okay okay
B,that kind of thing
A,Ya ya ya
B,Uh
A,I think that's provided by CIA
B,CIGNA Ya
A,CIA CIGNA ya
B,Uh it it normally they they do it hand in hand uh
A,Uhm
B,They package it such that it looks very cheap because uhm statistically death and disability by accidents is actually very small uhm percentage small risks as compared to all disabilities and all death cau causes of death disabilities
B,So these premiums are very low
A,Uhm
B,and they couple it with one that's only for limited period
B,They can bring down the premiums lah
A,Uhm
B,Okay
B,Uhm what else do you need to know
A,Uhm uhm
B,The let me try and recall okay
B,There's this other type which what is it uh
B,Have have you heard this critical illness
A,Oh ya the <unclear> word </unclear> eleven
B,insurance ya ya
A,something like that ya
B,That one is also comes under this type of category
A,Oh okay okay
B,Okay
A,Ya I think uh CIGNA that did mention that also <unclear> word </unclear>
B,Cannot recall CIGNA <unclear> word </unclear>
B,Well I would classify it under critical illness type
A,Uhm
B,Uhm they pay on diagnosis
A,Uhm
B,Right
B,Uhm it's sort of an enhanced uhm insurance over and above
A,Uhm
B,Just the purely temporary type
A,Okay
B,or the purely accident type
A,Okay
B,Uhm of course because it's an enhanced variety it costs you
A,Uhm
B,Okay risks are higher because you don't have to die okay you just need to suffer one of the following
A,Uhm
B,That's what it is
A,Okay
B,Okay
B,Uh what else do they have
B,I think that's basically it lah
B,It's it's only in the packaging
A,Uhm
B,Uhm I don't know whether
A,Uhm
B,how you you are the how the cheapest in the market go for it type or what
A,Uh
B,Rough overview lah
B,That's all I can think of right now
A,Ya ya okay
A,Uhm for this how difficult is it to claim
B,Uhm not difficult lah
A,Not difficult because I understand there were some there there're some medical terminology involved
A,It doesn't mean that you have a pain in the heart then you know that's it uh
B,I've spoken to our doctors
A,Uhm
B,normal doctors lah which are on our med panel
A,Uh
B,They think it's a fair definition
A,Is that right
B,Uh they think it it's actually good that these things are spelt out quite clearly
A,<unclear> word </unclear>
B,Well as long as the doctor says you've got a heart attack
A,Uhm
B,we should pay up
A,Uhm
B,I mean you can't claim based on certain symptoms that I have a heart attack
A,Uhm
B,when ECGY and everything Ys you don't
A,Of course
B,that's just <unclear> word </unclear> so
A,Okay
B,Uhm these tend to be more popular nowadays lah
A,Uhm
B,being a more affluent society
A,Ya
B,so we've more affluent diseases
A,Ya that's true
B,Uhm the criteria for underwriting would basically be your health and your parents' health
A,Oh parents' health
A,Oh okay
B,In case of hereditary diseases
A,Ya
B,like diabetes kidney you know which that kind of thing
A,Uhm
B,Kidney failure can can be a cause
A,Right right right
B,So if if your folks or if your parents are not alive and they suf they died of cancer and all
A,Uhm
B,it might be a minus lah
A,Uhm
B,from the underwriting point
A,Okay So the advantage of this is that it gives you protection uhm however <unclear> word </unclear>
B,It's on a temporary nature lah
B,The the one thing the advantage is actually the cost lah
A,Ya
B,What normally what we do when we propose is we normally package it with a savings type policy
A,Uhm
B,because if if you look at it over the long period of cover
A,Uhm
B,uhm it's basically an expense
A,Uhm
B,Uhm ya for this and it's sometimes they specially uhm work it into the policy that it increases
A,Uh huh
B,ten percent a year
B,Some personalised <unclear> word </unclear>
A,The premium or protection
B,Ya protection
A,Oh okay
B,Uhm but most of them don't
A,Uh huh
B,Uh so you would you're actually paying and paying and paying lah
A,Is that right
B,as opposed to a savings policy where effectively your savings and you're offsetting the premiums through the years
A,Oh uh huh
B,Because if if you if you have a savings value you've got premium outlay
A,Uhm
B,and as it as the savings increases and your premiums remain in constant
A,Uhm
B,you are actually offsetting the premium
A,Uhm
B,Just like an account that you're depositing all the time and not withdrawing
A,I I don't understand that part
A,What what do you how do you offset this thing again
B,Okay there's a portion in your present insurances which provides for savings right
A,Right
B,and you could put in your premiums as if they're deposits uhm <unclear> word </unclear>
B,Uhm I'm sure your agent would've explained to you that it probably starts from the third year onwards right
A,Uhm uhm Oh okay
B,So so if if let's say you deposit say two thousand dollars okay and year one year two year three <X>
A,Uhm
B,you've hit six thousand dollars
A,Uhm uhm
B,and year three begins your savings value according to your about three thousand dollars
A,Uhm uhm
B,so if you net it
A,Uhm
B,you're hardly would have actually been three thousand
A,Uhm
B,so over the three years it would actually cost you
A,Oh oh okay
B,out of pocket one thousand a year
A,Uhm uhm
B,So as as you go down through the years
A,Uhm
B,there'll be a break-even point sometime like eleven years
A,Okay ya okay
B,where effectively you've only lost interest
A,Uhm
B,and through the years there'll be a net return So in that sense
A,Oh oh okay
B,there's no loss
A,I see I see okay
B,Uhm
A,so all the interest lah
B,Ya but there's I think there's a offsetting along the way Finally catch up
A,Is that right
B,There is a small cost involved in insurance
A,Oh
B,the you pay significantly more premiums as compared to a temporary insurance the term insurance
A,Uhm
B,Uh but a lot of it is already <unclear> word </unclear> in the savings element
A,Uhm
B,You see uhm it it it cost maybe say fifty dollars or thirty dollars for a term It might cost you a hundred and fifty dollars for the same amount of insurance
A,Uhm
B,so that the insurance part is actually thirty dollars
A,Right
B,But hundred and twenty would actually go into savings lah
A,<unclear> word </unclear> Uh huh
B,if you look at it from that point of view
A,Uhm uhm okay
B,Okay That's what I meant lah
