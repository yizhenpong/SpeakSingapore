A,Alohah Kuna Thirty-six years old tak kachi chance
A,You were beating those youngsters

A,Do you feel great after that
C,Yes I I suppose I felt uh I felt good about uhm doing those kind of things
A,Did you feel bad walloping those youngsters
C,Uh no no no no I I uh no I never went out to wallop anybody
C,Ya I it was always uhm uh good feeling to be able to uh run with them uhm and and feel that hey I can still keep up with them that kind of feeling
A,You were not keeping up with them you were way ahead
A,We would like to talk about some secrets tonight
A,So can tell about tell us about your re regime
B,Oh we uh because it was I guess as uhm exploratory as pioneering as it was
B,Uh we were doing crazy things like uhm well at the time we were living half a mile from the Chinese Swimming Club and we were scaling the walls at five o'clock in the morning when it was pitch dark
A,Didn't they didn't open the gate for you
B,They didn't understand what that meant
B,I don't think even then I really did but it was fun scale the wall
A,So you were trespassing were you
B,We weren't trespassing nobody said anything they just thought well there goes those there goes those Chans they're all crazy bunch
A,That's part of the warm part of the warm-up right
B,Part of the warm-up part of the fun I think as children I think it if it haven't been that kind of adventure as well uhm it you know it's like not knowing what's coming round the corner
A,Will you do it again
B,Would I do it again
B,Not at my age no
A,Okay
B,But I'd do it probably do it again uhm with a lot better technology
B,We didn't really understand half the things we were doing you know we were just doing it because we loved it
B,Uhm because it's it's a very nice feeling to wake up in the morning you know if you're the only one doing this because you're half crazy
A,Nice feeling Okay
B,Nice feeling I mean I think you have to be slightly different breed
A,I take your word for it
A,Kuna at twenty-one you know you have to train as hard for the for the sprints
C,Yes
A,You didn't have to scale walls right
C,Uhm no we I think we had to scale some fences and hills because
A,You did wow full of trespassers
C,On uh on uh on the weekends and public holidays the the track would be closed and the there were several occasions when we had uhm I think have words with the watchman but we we we got got by
A,You two had very different experiences
A,Uh you started very young you started uh much later
A,Uh what's the ideal age to start
C,Well track and field they have to start uh being active from young
A,How young
C,Uh maybe even from twelve onwards so there is a systematic development in their youth
C,And then as they get into their late teens they can start uhm being a bit more serious about the training and then when they are in their twenties then they're they are prepared to train hard
A,Is there a a over the hill age
C,At I think maybe at one time we we thought wasn't enough over the hill age but uhm I think some world class athletes are showing that it's not true
C,Carl Lewis is already thirty and he he's he he still runs uh twenty seconds for the two hundred metres which is you know fantastic
B,A lot of sport is mind over matter
B,Uhm I think in in the last sort of twenty years people have discovered that uh the winners have it in their mind to win anyway
B,The the the power of the psyche over the body is something that uhm I think it's just has been really not been uh uhm utilised
A,So you must have the will right
A,What about the talent
B,I think like Kuna and and myself we were in in different ways spotted
B,Uhm I think you need to be recognised
B,You you may want to do something very desperately may want to be a top ballet dancer for example uhm and if you don't have the aptitude then it's very difficult
A,Well that's a good point
A,I like to come back to this point after the commercial break how to get talent spotted
A,It may do me some good to know that
B,Yes
A,It's time for a short break we'll be back
A,Before the break Pat Chan was telling us about the need for internal drive to become champions the need for talent and also the need to be talent spotted
A,Pat how does one get talent spotted
B,There's one of those one of those things of uh being the right place at the right time most of time uh but to get talent spotted you also have to have a a a real group talent scouts people are looking for talent and maybe the trouble in Singapore is that there aren't they that many people looking out
C,No I think this is where the school teachers come in isn't it uh because I think the the Physical Education teachers are better trained uhm and so they are in good position to uh spot talent
A,Are they doing it
C,Uh yes I think they are doing it but I think much of our talent is being wasted
A,Why
C,Uhm talking about the system
B,Yes
A,In what way
C,You need you need a very systematic development of these youths
C,Uh but we are losing them at a very early age we are losing them at 'O' levels 'A' levels and then we're losing them at very crucial stages maybe at when the boys go to NS and when uh they also go to university
B,We're not talent spotting either at at those crucial stages because if we can pull them out I'm not saying yes I'm not saying special privileges but I'm saying that if you recognise somebody has the potential they should be pulled out and put into special programmes otherwise you will never get the champions
B,Uh we could be sitting here twenty years from now and still be discussing these things
A,So what can we do about it
C,In Singapore we cannot run away uh from the fact that they must get these uh academic qualifications or uh or uh or career uh qualifications uhm because we are such a small country we the the the society cannot absorb people uh ex-champions and put them in in Vienna desk
C,They have to have some kind of qualifications
B,No they <unclear> word </unclear> they don't necessarily have to get those qualifications in the fields that we are accustomed to
B,They can be sent out to get uh uh you know either in sports medicine or sport psychology or whatever it is and then we bring them back as specialists and this is something we haven't done
B,They haven't had bursaries or scholarships to do that
C,But uh of course now we have uh the bursaries and scholarships
C,Uh I think in our time uh they were very far and few in between but now there are uhm monies available scholarships are are available and it the ball is now at the sportsmen's feet
A,Are you sure of that
C,But yah I'm I'm quite sure of that in the last
B,How long have they had these things
B,I mean how long have they have these bursaries and why haven't we seen real results
C,I I think the last three or four years at the most but
B,So you're saying that this is very in <unclear> word </unclear> at the moment
C,Yes but yah it and so it is the the sportsmen now have to make a choice uh uhm should I go on a scholarship uh what are the obligations ah if I go on a overseas scholarship uh do I concentrate on my training for sports or do I concentrate on my university education
A,But you can do both can't you
A,You can slow down your academic training maybe take longer to get a degree you maintain your your sporting
C,We we could that but if you're on a scholarship the expectations are a we send you for three years you do it in three years and come back please
A,Can't we stretch out the scholarship
C,Already we we should do that
C,But then uh uh money is involved but uh maybe we can work out something like that
C,But we can't do that kind of stretching out in in the local scene
A,Why not
B,Why not
C,I mean that's university uh uh policy isn't it now if if the course is three years you do it in three years you can't stretch it out
B,Well this comes back to what I was saying
C,Okay so maybe uh uh that's something that you know uh our tertiary institutions can think about
B,But I mean this this is the question uh do we have champions of any real real standard
B,Very few and far between the uh I mean the answer is there if you want to uh
C,You can make concession for these people
B,You have to
B,Everyone has to
B,I'm not saying that they're concessions but it's just being able to think a different way <X>
B,It's not a concession I don't think any athlete wants to be thought of as a concession
C,Yes I I agree with you Pat yes Uhm uhm maybe in certain areas we need some government uh uh intervention maybe in the area of national service uh some kind of arrangement has to be made there But there are many other areas where we can get uhm help and support
A,Name a few
