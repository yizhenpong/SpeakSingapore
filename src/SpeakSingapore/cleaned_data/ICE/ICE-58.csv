A,Our boys would be down there about three-thirty
B,You went to Novena already
A,Ah no
B,Later
A,I doubt if I can make it for today's session
B,Aiyah how terrible
A,And I feel bad also but the thing is uhm we're having a tournament coming up you see
B,Is it
A,organised by the School of Physical Education and you know
A,So I was gearing my boys up for the for the championship actually
B,So you got chance or not
A,Well I'll rate our chances as fifty fifty
B,I thought it's suppose to be at least semi-finals
A,Uhm well touch and go but I mean with a bit of luck we may just you know even clinch the title actually
B,You're suppose to ah
B,How many years already
B,To date this alternate year suppose to win
A,Ya we have but uhm a group and a bunch of dedicated boys you know committed
B,What about their coach
A,Well uhm
B,Tell me more about him lah the coach
A,Well what can I say
A,I mean you know with that kind of bunch of kids that you have you know
B,Is he a good coach or not
A,and the kind of enthusiasm that they have been showing and training you know
A,I think that's enough to carry me and get me going carrying on with what the job you see
B,So you saying the coach is not doing much lah
B,The boys are helping themselves
A,No I'm I'm sure the boy it's the boys who are going to be out in the field to play ultimately and the and the coach get only do that much
A,Fine I I feel deep down you know uhm that I've been quite inspirational and in a sense also been uhm very supportive the boys you know
A,And they look up to me that sense you know
B,As a friend rather than a
A,as a friend and also like a an older brother you see
B,So
A,And that's the interesting about teaching you know which I really enjoy because I realise that you know teaching is not just what goes round within the perimeters of a classroom
A,It extends beyond those boundaries
A,And just as much as you are learning so much about the students you are also learning so much about yourself
B,True true
A,See and I really enjoy what I am doing actually
B,Uhm so shiok lah
B,I then your speech how's your so how does your speech go
A,Oh ya
B,tell me
B,I never heard your speech
B,You're supposed let me hear how it goes
A,What what's there to say
A,But anyway next Saturday by the way uhm the school'll be having a speech day and the Minister of Education Lee Yoke Suan will be down and there is a strong probability that I am I have important uh official announcement will be made with regards to independ with regards to autonomous schools and and there's a strong chance in fact in fact highly probable that Victoria will be one of the schools going autonomous you see
B,What's auto what the difference between autonomous and independent
A,Autonomous are so call what they claim to be uh quality education at a low cost
A,But we're not really independent in the true sense of the word but we do have certain uhm leeway on the part of our principal you know
B,Planning and hiring
A,Like like the choice of teachers whom he wants to come over to our school and in terms of you know using funds because we would be given a grant of some seven hundred thousand dollars and you know
B,Not bad
B,That doesn't mean you can get pay rise lah
A,No not really pay pay rise because we still part and parcel of the Ministry of Education still you see
A,We're still under them but in terms of having uh electives being offered to students and we can sort of conduct some of our own programmes you see
A,So in that sense <X>
