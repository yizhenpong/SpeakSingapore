A,Now you were interviewed sometime ago uh by the Business Times I believe
A,I think it's called the conversation at Raffles and you made some very very
B,That's right
A,Uh shall we say very remarkable statements if I might say and the pardon me for putting on my glasses I would like to quote from what you've said
A,You said that there are three priorities for the Malay Muslim community in Singapore
A,To develop a Singapore brand of Islam to become active and even proactive players in forging an enhancing religious harmony in the country and to maximise the community's economic potential and you went on to include Malays to become must become more self confident to reach beyond the community and to want to do better
A,Uhm I suppose these are fairly self-evident truths and they are very logical and non-controversial
A,But what made you to put those principles in such stirring terms
A,I mean is there a need for that uh uh uh in Malay community
B,You know while we've as as a community the Malay Muslim community in Singapore has been through difficult times
B,I saw it first to know that in in in in three decades actually post independence
B,We first started off by feeling that you know that almost like everybody else owe us a living
A,That's rather strong oh boy
B,Yes and we thought that uh we're sort of sons of the soil we and and it's true actually not only of Singapore Malays but also practically of uh many developing countries achieving independence particularly in this area we felt that you know yah we we started this pointing
A,Special yah
B,we started pointed fingers at others
B,You owe us this you need to do this for us and I I'm reminded actually when I was in Jakarta last week I had the same example I used
B,I was reminded by a Javanese that you know when you point a finger someone it's only one finger but with three others pointing
A,pointing yourself yes
B,yourself Well I was told by this Javanese that in in the Malay or Indonesian way of pointing a finger is this way where you point one finger at others but four
A,inside
B,fingers pointing at yourself and I and we start thinking that you know is that really worthwhile every time pointing fingers at others
B,But let me quickly add to say that the Malay Muslim community has never been uhm short on uh self-help activities
B,But uhm it took sometime before we felt that we must work within the national framework
A,Yes
B,and and in the eighties when we felt we formed Mendeki
B,In fact it's a combination of many years of social activism which bought the various groups together
B,And I think uhm Mendeki has shown what we can achieve and what we can do if we sink our differences put our shoulders to the wheel and mind you hard work real hard work must come with it and and I made an example
A,May may may I cut in
B,Yes
A,May I cut in on this one
A,You mention one phase which caught uh which caught my ears sink our differences
A,Are there really significant differences or superficial differences within the community
B,Well our history has been filled with that and fortunately we came to realise that you know we just cannot go on uh with all this differences and I think unity is I think is uh critical
B,And I'm glad we have that now more than before and that way we can actually maximise our resources
A,I would like to sort of uh put something to you which may be a misconception uh on the part of many people in Singapore including myself that's that there is a perception of the fundamental conflict between religion the Islamic religion of the Islam and modernity if you agree that adjustments uh and accommodation have to be made between these two factors whether it is in fact uh possible to make successful uh uh integration in the long term
B,Can I uh preface my answer to that question by adding a point to my earlier answer and to say that there are problems
B,I hope I have not painted a too rosy a picture about uh the process of upliftment and to say that there are problems
B,And one of the problems is this question of reconciling differences in terms of perception
A,Yes
B,I think there's a serious gulf of perception between the Malays non-Malays and Muslims non-Muslims and the it's not because of religion but it's because of how Muslims practice their religion
B,If I may cite an example
B,I was in Libya in nineteen seventy-three
B,I was a student there and I was invited to attend an international conference and we went there happily looking forward to a model of Islam
A,A simple answer
B,Yes
A,Looking for a simple answer
B,In fact in fact it was proposed that uhm communism had failed capitalism had failed and the answer is the third international theory called the Green Book Islam
A,Oh yes yes I read about that yes
B,And uh but I must say that we came back very disillusioned very disappointed because even at that very conference we saw those contradictions we saw those uhm weaknesses and mind you that's within the fold of Islamic brotherhood within the fold of Islamic conference youth conference full of hopes and expectations
B,And I that made me feel why is it that we Muslims in Singapore must always look to one particular area be it Middle East or somewhere else
A,Yes
B,for that reference points
B,I agree that the cradle <unclear> word </unclear> of Islamic realisation was Mecca and for a long time Middle East was in fact the reference point
B,But we are different We are urban we are industrial we are global
B,But I'm not saying that we we don't have those cultural and religious pools whether in the region or in the context of the international omma the Muslim
A,Yes
B,But I think uh with our own uh needs and our own challenges we must find new reference points which will provide us those kind of answers where is more relevant to our need
B,I'm not saying that uh they are so many Islam there is only one Islam
A,Yes
B,But let me also add to say that why is it that we have differences in in practices in all over the Muslim world
B,But
A,Okay okay we got to take a commercial break now but I like to leave something with you uh we can chat about it uh later on
A,Uhm perhaps what I'm trying to to to put to you is that surely there is not a zero sum game as far as this is concerned I I would imagine that even within the the boundaries of the Islamic faith uh one doesn't have to consider that if you in fact uh exist and succeed in the secular society you do have to trade off something
A,Uh we'll come back to you later on
A,And don't go away now we'll be back and where I'm gonna put that question to Zainal once again
A,See you later
A,Welcome back before we took the commercial break I was putting the question to Zanial as to whether religion and modernity is a zero sum game May I have your views on this one Zainal
B,Let me say that it must be a win win situation for us There's no other way
B,There will be difference some matter of perception some reality and uh I think we got to learn to manage those differences
B,I say a win win situation because Islam calls for modernity Islam calls for progress and Islam calls for tolerance
B,You know Islam is a very multi-cultural society in fact and I think uh I'd see no reason why Islam cannot uh succeed in a secular state like Singapore and I would like to say that Singapore gives us all the challenges to be good Muslims
B,It's not gonna be easy but the challenges are there and it's up to us actually to work
A,This is a very interesting set of uh facts
A,Why is it that the people in general don't seem to know these I mean from appearance anyway and from what one hear as in these these not the issues that are often front-ended to any discussion
A,Uh one tends to see much more uh uh back to the nature sort of thing But why why is that so
B,Well I think uhm there is historical baggage we can't deny that whether for cultural reasons racial reasons or religious reasons there have been those there have been those times where it it really does not help But uhm I'm optimistic and I'm confident that we will be able to make some headway
B,We have been making headway and I think there's better willingness on the part both or both Malays non-Malay Muslims and non-Muslims to reach out and learn from each other
B,Let me site one another example if you don't mind Bob
A,Please please do
B,I went to a forum
A,Yes
B,and I was on the panel and I was uh a Chinese gentleman stood up and say you know what the problem with you all is that you are Muslims
B,If you are Malays you are alright Can you imagine that
A,Does he really know what this is
B,I I mean I thought at first it was very uh facetious but I thought and thought about it and I thought that this it reflects a very serious problem
B,Because I think quite a lot of non-Malays here see Malays as very gentle very easy going people
B,But how did they look at Islam
B,How do they look at Muslims
B,Perhaps overseas fundamentalists radical militant
A,They're the guys who grab the headlines
B,problems everywhere
A,I mean they're the guys who grab the the headlines you see but there could be a certain amount of concern a certain amount of uh ignorance
A,Uhm perhaps this is the gulf that M U I S uh uh would you see this to be uh uh a gulf that M U I S should attempt to address
B,You know I if I may again uh site another anecdote you know
B,I remember when the debate about G R C was on and I remember if I'm not mistaken that Captain Ho who had made a submission and was saying that we should not go for G R C because it gave the Malays or the minority groups a certain political leverage and I remember Senior Minister or Prime Minister then you know Prime Minister you ask him where do you live
B,I think is was Hougang if I am not mistaken and he said do you have Malay friends
B,Do you know the Malays and the Muslims and he said no
B,And I think that's the point and I feel uh the more of Muslims reach out to understand what the others feel and similarly the if more non-Muslims try to reach out and understand how Muslims and Malays feel I think there can be that greater uh understanding
A,Zanial if I may out to push you a little bit on the last comment that you made I would like to share with you perhaps rightly or wrongly two perceptions
A,First is that the Malay community uh has been marginalised in the development of the Singapore society
A,The other thing is that ever since Singapore's independence some thirty-eight odd years ago the rest of the society has in fact moved forward
A,Do you think that the last thirty years have been wasted
B,Marginalised may be too strong a word
B,You know I remember that quite a number of Malay friends of mine who were very upset when uh we say that the Malays were not in the mainstream
B,They feel that the Malays have been part of the mainstream
