B,Uh oh after that benefactor experience when the small kid he says something like Sometimes in life uh no not in life sometimes you have a look just a little brush with real life
A,Uh ya
B,And that's when you really experience
B,You know what life can really be that tremendous experience that he has as a kid when Robert DeNiro like captured him and made him made him do certain things and things like that
A,Uhm
B,Ya
B,That that
A,I I I also like that part when uh Finn says I'd like to tell the story

B,Ah
A,But <{> <[> as I remember </[>
B,Ya <[> as you remember </[> </{> ya
B,That's beautiful

B,It was like love like love first at first sight
A,Mm uhm
B,Say that uh like the like Estella say that   Can you ever forgive me   Say that {   don't you understand me
A,{ orhh
B,Then they look at each other without saying a single thing and the narrator say that she understood all along

B,Class boundaries uh years
A,Uhm yes
B,Ya
A,Many years
