A,Mr Chiam
B,Thank you Sir for allowing me to speak
B,Sir I'm heartened to hear that the recruitment of teachers have improved uh to over a thousand last year
B,But the Minister uh perhaps could also enlighten us as to the attrition rate or the drop out rate of teachers from the from their jobs
B,Now I'm always concerned in fact every year I bring up this subject of shortage of teachers in our secondary and primary schools
B,Uh when there are not enough teachers to go around the teacher-student ratio will naturally be low
B,How I complain of this many times in this House of the class size in nearly all government and government-aided schools
B,Uh these class size are too large when they are between forty to forty three and uh pupils in such a class uh can never get effective teaching in particular in these days when the work load imposed on our school children is so heavy
B,The teachers are given very wide syllabus to cover and they have to go very quickly through them and of course the average uh pupils uh would find it very difficult to cope up
B,Uh they then they do not do so well in their examinations and their parents get very worried
B,Working mothers are left in a dilemma whether to continue working or to stay at home stop work and help their children out in their studies
B,In the past uh normally only those who can afford will employ private tutors to coach their children
B,but in these days when academic qualifications are so important to get good jobs even those parents who really cannot afford to have uh tutors uh tighten their belts make sacrifices and save money to employ tutors to help out their children in their studies
B,So of course this will cause uh greater financial burden on these parents
B,Now and the government wants to encourage learning of mother tongues in our schools that is something which I support
B,Now but the teaching of the standard of teaching of mother tongue have been dropping in our schools
B,Why
B,Because there is an acute shortage of teachers and they are too many pupils in the class
B,uh the shortage of teachers is a very basic fundamental flaw in our schools
B,Uh the government says that it's trying hard to solve this uh problem
B,uh in fact I think the government has no choice
B,The government should uh sort sort this very uh basic fundamental basic uh educational uh problem
B,Otherwise all the talk about Edusave and the full day schools will be of little use
B,Now last year the Institute of Edu uh last year the Minister said that the Institute of Education is not producing enough teachers
B,uh well I know the Minister is doing everything it can but I hope this will not be seen as an excuse
B,Thank you
A,Mr Low
A,You you wanted to speak
A,No
C,It's under uh Head L right
C,No just now I want to seek some clarification from the Minister
A,Yes you want to seek your clarification
C,Uh what is the turnover uh rate of teachers in the uh uh of our of the Ministry of Education
A,Dr Tan
D,Sir just want to seek a clarification from the Senior Minister of State
D,I know there is this policy of not accepting graduates who do not have two teaching subjects as uh teachers
D,I was wondering whether the Ministry has would like to review this policy because there are I'm sure
D,there are some uh graduates who may not have two teaching subjects for example a graduate in nus history and politics
D,Would they consider would the Ministry consider accepting such uh graduates as teachers
D,Thank you
A,Dr Tay
E,Sir uh turn first to the point made by uh Mr Chiam
E,Uh I've already spoken quite uh extensively about the uh recruitment of teachers to try to meet the shortage situation so I will not repeat myself
E,Uhm his point about class size uh is something that he brings up almost every year uh predictably
E,Mr Chiam has the opinion that uh to have good education you must keep your class sizes small the smaller the better
E,Uh I don't know where he has obtained this uh information from
E,I suspect he has obtained it from his western contacts because it is true in uh UK United States they uh one of the key points that had been made by many people is they must keep class sizes small the smaller the better twenty five twenty per class
E,But but does Mr Chiam that in these two countries in UK and US there is a great deal of unhappiness about education
E,In fact there's a lot of criticism about the dropping standards of education in these two countries
E,and this is a subject which will affect the elections in Britain in April and possibly the American elect Presidential election in November
E,So I don't think uh he should just simply uh quote or ape something which has been uh widely touted in another place and say that this is a solution for Singapore
E,It is much more I think this class size issue is over-rated
E,If you look at Japan Korea Taiwan their class sizes are bigger than ours On a regular basis it's between forty five and fifty per class and I remember visiting a very good school in Seoul Korea
E,Their class sizes were sixty per class
E,They managed to do quite well
E,Their their students in fact excel and are held up by the American educationists as examples of students who are doing so well and of a system that is far better than theirs
E,I think we should see these things in balance
E,We have a class size of about thirty six and it varies from year to year depending on the uh the number of classes that are created
E,It has served us well
E,I don't think there has been any uh worry that because of the class size of thirty six you know our school results are suffering
E,In fact each year to the amazement of many people the results seem to be improving
E,This year's 'O' level results and 'A' level results have been the best ever
E,I think what is more important I'm ya are you dealing
C,I don't believe that the class size has nothing to do with the quality of education
E,You don't believe it
C,because because if you have a smaller size of class the teacher will have more attention pay more attention and more time to cater for individual students
E,It's it isn't as simple as that my friend
E,I was going to come with this next point
E,What are what are the key factors for success in school
E,Since the Mr Chiam Mr Low are very concerned about this
E,What are the key factors of success in school
E,I think first the basic ability of the child is very important The child is endowed with certain abilities that is very basic and important
E,Secondly the motivation of the child is important also
E,The child may be very bright in terms of his endowment if he is unmotivated he will not do well he will not pay attention to his studies
E,So motivation is important
E,What are the what are the avenues of motivating the child
E,The school is definitely an important avenue and that's why I said that the principal and his team of teachers are really the core the heart of the school
E,By doing a good job in running the school they are motivating the children under their charge concentrate on their lessons to do well in their ECA to do all kinds of things they want them to do
E,But beyond the school motivation by parents is perhaps even more important
E,Let me explain why I say this
E,I've just come across a study
E,This is a study of children of Vietnamese refugees who are studying in American schools in California
E,To the amazement of everybody these children who speak hardly any English when they start school are doing very well in their schools in their neighbourhood schools compared with American children who are not doing well at all in the schools
E,So studies have been done in this
E,Why
E,The same school different children
E,One does well one doesn't do very well
E,There must be some other reason
E,The reason is outside the school
E,They found in their studies that the Vietnamese parents of these children pay a great deal of attention toward their children
E,They may not be highly educated themselves Many of them are in fact not rich at all
E,They are refugees but they pay attention to what their children do
E,they encourage them they supervise them where they can and as a result of that kind of encouragement the children concentrate on their work and they do well in the American system
E,Now what is true of the Vietnamese children is also true of children in Singapore and anywhere else in the world
E,If there is parental interest if there's warmth and encouraging support from parents even if the parents are not rich even if the parents do not have a high education but they are interested in what their children are doing the children will do better in school
E,That has been proven again and again from many studies
C,Is the Minister implying that those students who are not doing well or their parents are not interested
A,Mr Low in future if you have
C,Oh sorry
A,<unclear> word </unclear> to raise could you please ask for my permission first
A,all right
E,I think the member should take the whole thing in context not just pick on one point
E,On the other hand it is true that there are parents who unfortunately are very nervous about their children's education
E,uh they are negative in the way they deal with their children
E,I think this discourages the children
E,It shakes up their self-confidence and in fact the children do worse
E,So my advice to parents is to take a positive attitude to be very encouraging and not to use the opposite which is to scold them to criticise them and to compare them with other children and say why is it your you can't do better than them
E,I think this discourages the child
E,The reason may be to help them to do better but the result is the opposite
E,On a subject of turnover of teachers in our schools
E,uhm in fact the turnover rate in our schools is not high
E,Uh we have a turnover rate of staff of about two to three percent a year
E,Now if you compare that with the turnover in many other industrial in uh economic sectors I think the turnover rate of teachers is quite low
E,Uh Dr Tan Cheng Bock has asked the question about graduate teachers or graduates who have who do not have two teaching subjects
E,Uh I think I have to refer this to the uh Public Service Commission or the Education Service Commission because they are responsible for the recruitment of teachers
E,uh and they also lay down the rules on what is minimum requirement
E,But the reason why two teaching subjects have been put in for graduates is because most teachers can be expected to teach two subjects not just one
E,So it's quite necessary for them to have two teaching subjects
A,Yes Mr Chiam
B,Sir can I just one ask one question
B,Sir
B,Now I thought you have finished
B,Can I ask one question
A,Go ahead Mr Chiam
A,Go ahead
B,Just one one one question only
A,Yes go ahead
B,Uh I would ask the Minister assuming that the school under all conditions are similar and in one school you have got a class size of twenty five another school with a class size of sixty which school would you send your child to <X>
