A,With me tonight are three observers of the political scene
A,Mr Goh Chok Tong has asked for the endorsement for his premiership and he says the PAP will get their endorsement if it improves on its 1988 percentage
A,By how many percentage points
A,Do you think it will have to improve to gain a comfortable margin Bilveer
B,Ya while dangerous to speculate I think after Nomination Day results and in view of the lack of general substantive issues ah as I see in this particular election my guess is to get a clear mandate anything between sixty four to sixty eight would be regarded in my view as a clear endorsement
A,Thian Ser do you share the view
C,It's not a bad number to put into a ball park area
C,In part because the Prime Minister has said that he wants more open views
C,So once you allow a system where you begin to relax uh the system to allow more people to come in and debate issues there is bound to be uh less of a consensus that we saw a couple of elections back when it was as high as eighty odd percent
C,So somewhere between sixty odd to seventy
C,Seventy'll be a very good number
C,I think those are reasonable standards Peter
D,Well I wouldn't want to box the poor Prime Minister in with numbers you know because uh I think the the way the campaign is fought you know is more important than longer term
D,It's so easy to say he's got so many more points percentage points so he's got the endorsement he's done better
D,But more important is the people's uh feed uh perception of the confidence level of the government
A,Well I was coming to that point as to whether you know there is another measure because he did talk about the people's perception and what do you understand by that Peter
D,Well I understand well I don't know what I can't be reading his mind but I would say this some people are saying look why so kiasu you know why the suddenness of this election uh and a few other things like that
D,Is the gov does the government know something that we don't know
B,Is the economy going to go plunging down
B,So I think there's some recovery there you know so it's uh the perception of how confident government is uh how much leeway it gives the opposition uh I don't say backward backwards you know because even in sports you know you you you gain every advantage you can according to the rules of the game
C,If I could just go back to the point that you made as to why this election is being called now
C,Why in fact is Mr Goh going to the election at this point when uh after the 1988 election the PAP did say that the win could be interpreted as a mandate for the new team
C,So why in fact is Mr Goh going for an election now
D,I I think uh because he thinks the conditions are right you know and this is the best time for the best win
D,I think he has put a very strong case that he wants the people to judge him for who he is and his style
D,His National Day Rally performance was by any observer's view a very good performance
D,And he's trying to establish himself once and for all that this is his cabinet this is his government
D,So I think this campaign hangs on his personality and whether the changes have taken place because we have seen accommodation of uh some of the ? opposition type views into the PAP's style of government now
D,At one time it was the the general consensus was that the government is very confident of itself it states its case that's it
D,But now we're getting a position where the PAP is sort of saying well we have a position but we're willing to listen to the public we're listen to to to to the voters
D,That's happen in say the ah car policy that's now happening in the area of health cost
D,So I think Mr Goh says to be judged on his personality and approach it it would be appear to be an important issue here
D,I would agree with clear with things here that the real question is actually political legitimacy
D,I think there is a feeling that he has been given the premiership without the mandate of the people and now he think the timing is right
D,Economically politically the ground is sweet that uh this is better than anytime to go to the people because he will have to go to the people either 92 or 93 so judging from that political uh soundness I think he's going to the people for the simple reason of legitimacy nothing more than that
D,Well following up from what you say can I say something here?
D,He's already there legitimate because at the last election it was quite clear that year Mr Lee Kuan Yew was going to hand over so uhm the mandate is already there uhm
D,I think there's a clear difference in this time zone Peter in the sense that since that mandate was given to him he has made several changes more in style if you like more open approach also substance
D,Now this is where this is where the measure is being taken and I feel that you know the Nomination results are not in his favour because he will he already has a majority
A,Would you would you say that the change in policy direction that you talked about is sufficient reason to seek a fresh mandate
C,I think it is sufficient because the change has been happening fairly rapidly and it's time to take a measure of how people are reacting
C,I think the the worries over the economy probably there's some pros in it I mean what's happened in Russia is very major
A,Is the government concerned about the possible economic downturn
A,I'm not sure they hasn't said that openly but uh many people in the business sector are concerned of possible fears because cost are still rising in the economy and that's a problem
D,And I think in addition to that ah in this country I think what hits the pocket is politically significant and I think there is a perception I mean it may be wrong but at least there's a perception even in the public mind that the economy is taking slowly but surely a flight
D,And politically if you don't hit now and you hit later whether in 92 or 93 I think it can be costly
D,So it's from that perspective that I think the timing factor and its relationship with economic cannot be dismissed
A,If we can come back to Mr Goh pushing himself as the issue in this election uh is there a risk for him in doing this Peter
C,I think uhm it's a big risk but I think being the uh good politician a good leader that he is he is he has organised the environment so that uh it's a it's a risk as a bold move it's a risk but uh minimum risk because uh you know he he's he hasn't talked about opposition type issues
B,Uh I agree with Thian Ser except that I won't call it opposition type issues I I say the concerns of the people you know
B,I think in the past opposition grappled some of those concerns much better than the PAP but now the PAP has uh has taken the initiative on many of these issues that affect people's feelings and people's aspirations
B,I think one result of a strong victory in this coming general elections would be that the PAP is seen to have institutionalized itself because in the past we have the leadership on the Prime Minister Lee very capable very strong and to a certain extent very dogmatic in approach
C,It's nothing wrong in that it give us twenty-five years of success but I think what we are saying now is a new approach and if that's a endorsed strongly by the people then we have seen that most people will accept that the PAP is get around for many more years to come and perhaps one good result of that would be that together with that exception uh sorry with that acceptance of the PAP as a the ruling party as long as it accepts a wider range of views together with that will be acceptance of opposition
A,Pick up from what you're saying about the opposition now the SDP has made a call for this election to be treated as a by-election
A,How far do you see them getting with this
D,I think by virtue of the fact that uh the PAP has already had a walk-over victory this effect is likely to be enhanced that makes Mr Goh's job a lot tougher
D,I think the PAP has to campaign much much strongly
D,There are a few uh areas it would appear where candidates who performed well in the last election are standing again
A,So do you see I'm talking about opposition candidates
A,Do you see a replay of some of the major contests for example in Bukit Gombak and Eunos
B,Possibly possibly I think a lot of people will be watching Eunos not that the candidates uh put on either side I think because both sides have put forward interesting candidates and obviously a swing in the GRC is very significant in terms of the majority and that will have a real effect
C,I in fact I would differ a bit I think the SDP's strategy is making a virtue out of necessity
C,That's one point of looking at it because I think they will caught but uh on the other hand about the swing I think basically there are four factors which will affect an election outcome
C,One would be I think the people's desire for a PAP government which has been achieved
C,There are three other factors I think the type and nature of natural national issues type and nature of local issues and finally they need to signal to the government about what it can do and cannot do
C,I think the the other three will affect the swing and my feeling is at this present time the ground is far more sweeter compared to 88 when there were a lot of sulfurist issues and I think I do not uh share Kansas' view that it's going to be a shift
A,So what you're saying is that there are no national issues that's bothering the public at this point
C,I I would think there's no national substantive issue which can fundamentally affect the flavour and uh to that extent I think it's going to work on Mr Goh's advantage
C,I think Mr Goh's halo effect is going to play itself down to the local constituencies whereas in the past the local issues were very critical I mean you talk of whether the MP meets the man or not whether that you what what what type of flats you're living in so on and so forth
C,But I think this time now it's different because we are seeing a major political transition a lot of the past issues were in fact related to Mr Lee and his style
C,This time I think it's Mr Goh and his style and he's seeking an endorsement
C,I think people will go out to vote if not for anything at least for Mr Goh
C,I've heard people saying I like Mr Goh I don't like the MP I don't know what to do but I'd rather vote with Mr Goh than take a gamble you know
A,Peter do you think in announcing a by-election in twelve to eighteen months Mr Goh has in fact undercut the strategy of the opposition <X>
