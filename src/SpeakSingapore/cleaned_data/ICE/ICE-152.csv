A,Sir number of uh members have uh spoken on the tax relief for reservists
A,I thought I want to uh briefly respond to some of the points
A,Uh firstly Mr Leong Hong Kee uh suggested instead of the uh thousand dollars tax relief for active reservists and uh five hundred for non-active reservists
A,that we change to a different system of giving a hundred dollars and fifty dollars flat rate
A,Sir there're many different ways of uh providing a tax relief
A,uh the flat rate is one way
A,the method that we propose is another uh Mindef is looking into this problem uh fairly extensively over the last year or so
A,Uh I prefer the uh method that we propose on a number of reasons on a number of grounds
A,Firstly the proposal that we have is symbolic
A,It's it shows very clearly government's deep appreciation and gratitude the reservists for the uh sacrifices that they've made for the contributions that they continue to make uh to the nation's well-being by providing security and peace
A,These are the essentials
A,these are the foundations upon which the nation is able to progress and to prosper
A,Sir the method that we propose is also simple and comes closest to what as been uh considered by the uh record committee and uh recommended by the uh reservists
A,I think if Mr Leong were to look into the uh details and uh look at the numbers he will probably share the uh conclusion that I uh have arrived at
A,namely the proposal that Mindef has come out with is beneficial much more beneficial to reservists in the long run because this way as the years go by as the income of reservists increases the amount of uh relief that they get will increase
A,in other words the tax that they pay will be diminished by a bigger margin than the flat rate of fifty dollars or a hundred dollars Indeed if <unclear> word </unclear> workers were to have the pay increase by an average about seven percent per year over a ten-year period you'll be talking about almost a doubling of the income and over a forty-year period
A,which is what we are going to give in terms of tax relief to uh reservists from the age of twenty
A,and if they continue working until they're sixty there's a forty-year period
A,that Mr Leong were to sit down and do some calculations he will appreciate that the uh relief that we are giving is not insignificant
A,So Mr Chiam has said that the tax relief is too small which does suggest that uh if it were bigger he would have given his uh full support
A,And yet at the same time he says we should not make any uh monetary uh reward any monetary recognition because in so doing if money is involved then we make mercenaries out of our reservists Is that right
B,Yes
A,Sir Mr Chiam may not be aware of the fact that uh we are already making allowances of all sorts to our reservists
A,We give the key appointment holders a key appointment uh uh holder allowance
A,nd allowance
A,Others we have a service uh allowance and uh for all the uh reservists we have a make-up pay
A,Does Mr Chiam therefore suggesting that we take away all these allowances because money is involved
B,Sir can I clarify
C,<unclear> word </unclear>
A,Yes <$B  <
B,Thank you thank you
B,Now money are given in all kinds of ways but if you give in a form of a reward then it is wrong in principle
B,but if you give to compensate for his transport allowance for his loss of earning I think that is fair
B,That this this completely different principle payments are made out on a different principles
B,But if there is going to be appreciation you can give him a plaque
B,you can put him on a pedestal
B,and give him a clap or you can put up a statue
B,These these are different kinds these are different kinds of appreciation
B,So we must appreciate what sort of appreciation we are giving and not to dish out money and we say we're happy that you are doing reservist
B,I think that is wrong in principle
B,That is my point
A,Sir I think uh Mr Chiam is entitled to his point of view
A,What we have done is to structure it in a manner that it expresses the nation's appreciation
A,It's a symbolic gesture the amount of money is a matter of difference of uh
A,it's a matter of opinion whether it's large or otherwise but making recognition through a monetary system need not necessarily make mercenaries out of our people
A,Sir indeed mercenaries are really soldiers professional soldiers who fight in foreign armies not our own people being paid or being given a uh a a monetary uh recognition
A,Indeed armies all over the world pay their soldiers that doesn't make all the soldiers of the world mercenaries
A,So we give allowances to our national servicemen
A,Is Mr Chiam therefore saying that we should not do that
A,Sir Dr John Chen suggests that because Mr uh Chiam said that he's not in favour of this system we should not uh make uh payment to uh or make the uh system make the uh tax relief available to uh reservists in Potong Pasir
A,Sir I don't think we should do that because I don't believe I don't believe Mrs Mr Chiam speaks for the uh reservists in Potong Pasir
A,But if there are if there should be any reservist in Potong Pasir who shares Mr Chiam's point of view they can easily opt out the system by not making the claim by not making
B,Can can I can I have a second clarification
C,Are you giving away
A,Sir if the if Mr Chiam will just let me finish the sentence
C,All right Mr Chiam
C,You can seek your clarification later
A,If any reservist in Potong Pasir shares Mr Chiam's point of view and think that recognition through a monetary system is not appropriate they can very easily opt out of it next year by not making a claim
A,It is as simple as that
C,Yes Mr Chiam
B,Sir there are two points I want to raise
B,firstly whenever I put up a criticism they will point to Potong Pasir
B,Potong Pasir can always opt out
B,Where are we going to end
B,Very soon there'll be more than one Potong Pasir and what's going to happen
B,They can all opt out
B,So can if they are not happy with their income tax can they opt out
B,I would like to ask the Minister of Finance for that
B,If we are unhappy we criticise the income tax property tax Can we opt out
B,Sir that that is the first point
B,Sir the the second point is that Sir in in regard to to this whole matter of uh enough or not enough the the whole idea is wrong so
B,it's not a question of quantum the quantum is is no longer an issue
B,It is it is it is it is the principle that is involved
B,so so if you are going to give monetary rewards for service to the nation then where are we going to end
B,Because service to the nation cannot be measured by money terms and we all know that Public service this kind of things services to charity these are all in the same category
B,so this kind of work we do out of either commitment or either of service or duty to the nation or for the love of it
C,Mr Chiam are you making a speech or you're seeking clarification
C,Mr Chiam
B,But certainly it is not for the money
B,That is the last thing in mind
A,Sir Mr Chiam Mr Chiam obviously didn't hear what I say
A,I say that I do not agree with Dr John Chen not to make that uh tax relief available to all reservists in Potong Pasir
A,No but if you speak on behalf of them and indeed if there are reservists who believe exactly as you do which I think will be exceedingly small number
A,Then as I said they can easily exercise their right not to claim not to make that claim next year
A,Sir I think we've spent enough time on uh Mr Chiam we move on
A,Uh Dr Ho Peng uh Mr Ho Peng he has suggested that uh now we should consider not making available the tax relief for those who have completed their reservist training and also for those who are not doing any reserves uh not uh actively in reserve
A,This is a distinct possibility which we look at uh during the consideration of this proposal uh made by record
A,So what that means is we will only be making a tax relief available for thirteen years because uh most of the reservists will serve a thirteen-year in-camp training cycle
A,and after that after that they will not have not enjoy any tax relief at all
A,So over the last eleven years I've been round the uh army camps the bases
A,I've been into the jungle with our soldiers
A,I've seen them training and I appreciate the amount of effort that they put in
A,I appreciate the amount of sacrifices they've put in
A,I believe that we should express in a manner that is commensurate with the way in which the uh soldiers have put in terms of sacrifices and contribution to the nation for us
A,I have therefore decided that the tax relief will be available even after they've completed their reservist training
A,In other words it's an expression life-long expression on the part of the government for the uh reservists as long as he's contributed in national service
A,as long as he's contributed in reserves he will continue to receive that tax relief or be it at a slightly lower level
A,When they're doing active uh reserve training we give them a relief at a higher level
A,Sir there's also a small number of people who for medical reasons largely uh do not uh carry on to do reserves uh after they've finished their NS
A,I've decided that it would be mean it would be mean on the part of Mindef not to allow these people also to enjoy the tax relief
A,and therefore I've decided that they too will enjoy the tax relief again at the lower level of five hundred dollars instead of a thousand
A,I will really be splitting hairs to say that reserve service is much more important much more valuable
A,and therefore to be regarded at a higher level recognised by the government but not national service which all of them have completed
A,And that is the basis that is the reason for my deciding to make the tax relief available to all all who have completed national service but for those who are in active reserve to receive a slightly higher level of tax relief
A,So Dr John Chen and uh Mr Liew Sing Paw both uh reservist officers have uh spoken uh positively of the uh tax relief
A,Uh our own uh indications surveys had uh shown that majority of Singaporeans support this particular relief
A,Uh Mr Liew suggested that indicated that this does give uh reservists a very much higher level of status and I agree with him
A,Indeed Mindef will be uh liaising with the Ministry of Defence to uh encourage the Ministry of Defence
A,I beg your pardon
A,Mindef will be liaising with the Ministry of Finance to encourage the Ministry of Finance to put a star next to the names of all reservists <X>
