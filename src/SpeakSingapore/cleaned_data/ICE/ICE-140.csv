A,Welcome to the programme Mister David Marshall
B,Thank you
A,May I sort of begin our conversation by drawing on one of the uhm the comments that you made in the short video clip uh just at that before it concluded
A,Have the years indeed mellowed you
B,Well the fire in the belly is embers now but it can always be fan to flame by injustice
B,I have a deep emotional desire for human justice
B,Uh a deep feeling for respect for my fellow human beings
B,That has not altered
B,My capacity to seek to develop these ideas into a practical improvement of conditions of course is very much less and with age a few windows closed
A,You have held some very strong views of what you feel Singapore and Singaporean should be and the if I may uh take the liberty of quoting an interview from an interview you had in nineteen eighty-eight
A,Uhm you said and if I may quote you Mister Marshall we have not come of age
A,We are adolescents
A,We have ability but no grace
A,We exaggerate our importance and forget that we are no more than a pinpoint on the globe
A,We have a long way to go and I heard that we go that road in humility
A,I think these are sentiments <unclear> word </unclear>
A,What drove you to express those opinions in nineteen eighty-eight
B,Well the the realities of the situation then
B,I was seeking to tell our people look this is how it is today but because there are defects this is how it can be improved
B,Whether I was right or wrong is irrelevant
B,I was honest about it
B,And let's be fair in the last eight years I think we've taken a giant step
B,I was until Thursday I was Dean of the Commonwealth Ambassadors in Paris and there were every month we had lunch and I meet about twenty-three twenty-four ambassadors most of them from the third world and the respect for Singapore was a joy a real joy
B,So we're no longer an uh irrelevant pinpoint
B,We are a very relevant a global city
B,That's a long way to go As for graciousness in my embassy I get officers constantly changing
B,And my impression is that the officers who have come to Paris recently are far more sophisticated with a a growing sense of the graciousness of living Uh my minister Wong Kan Seng gave me a dinner to farewell me
B,He and his Misses Wong Brigadier-General Yeo and his wife heads of government depart all the departments of the foreign office and a beautiful silver <unclear> word </unclear> to farewell me ten years ago eight years ago
B,That would not have happened spending public money on a function that produced no money
B,But he understood the meaning uh and the worth the worthwhileness of a gracious act
B,That's important
A,Yes yes
A,But but sorry for interrupting but would this be applicable generally to all Singaporeans I mean we still see a lot of grabbing out
A,We still see many manifestations of self-interest and surely that is that goes against the uh the the perception of gracious to be honest
B,Uh not self-interest
B,Self-interest is part of human nature
B,You know Mao Zi Tong tried to change it and failed
B,No no no let let's get our picture right
B,Yes we are the new ridge okay
B,Uh yes we haven't got the sophistication fully yet
B,But we are getting there
B,Our people are a very decent people and a very reasonable people and frankly I'm delighted to be born in Singapore
B,I like them they've been wonderful to me
B,So when you talk of graciousness yes there's a lot of uh scrabbling for money
A,Yes
B,It's it's a I think it's the fault of the government
B,They keep insisting on merit and and and uh uhm merit is uh expressed in uh the medals in my chest and the money in my bank account
B,But uh let's be fair again you know
B,The other night Community Chest Centre I had Goh Chok Tong speak of compassion and solidarity
B,We're coming along I mean George Yeo last week was it uh he put forward uh uh a very heroic plan for uh development for cultural activity of our people
B,So I see these glimmers uh of our understanding that now we have filled the rice bowl we must move on to the quality of living beyond our physical needs
B,And frankly as I see our people they enjoy they like they appreciate and they accept uh tendencies to greater respect for the human individual for the graces of living for the grace of human relations
B,I'm I'm I'm not uh I'm not pessimistic I'm much more optimistic today than I was eight years ago
A,Wouldn't there be any pitfalls that we have got to be worried about
B,There are two challenges
B,One is racial harmony and look I I'm a critic of the P A P but in fairness they have done a wonderful job of softening antagonisms of fair play for all communities and so long as this tradition lasts of respect for minority groups and there is respect for minor then we're alright
B,There is an emphasis too great an emphasis but then maybe I'm unSingaporean in this on money values For me you know I say after eighty-five years of living I believe that human relations are far far more satisfying than the money in my bank and the medals on my chest and there I have them
A,Yes
A,I'm afraid we got to go for a short break now Mister Marshall but before we go I will just like to uh leave you with a thought that in view of the present stage of development of Singapore we are subject to more open influences and one of those uh influences that are now prevade that is now prevading the world is this question of human rights and human freedom individual freedom
A,But uh we'll take a break now and we'll come back and take up this question
A,Don't go away now we'll be back to discuss and continue with this conversation
B,That's a global question
A,Welcome back
A,Before we took the break Mister Marshall I raised the point of human rights and personal freedom
A,I think this is a point which confronts a lot of those of us in Singapore when we read about the sort of <unclear> word </unclear> that go on internationally but what exactly how do you see this question of human rights
B,That's a global question affects more than Singapore
B,As I see it historically the Asian approach is founded on Confucian thought mainly
B,Two thousand five hundred years ago Confucius had such giant task of trying to bring order to a chaos across the vast country
B,So he evolved a philosophy which is quite essential for the time to bring order is a philosophy of primacy of the community's welfare
A,Yes
B,respect for authority
B,Legitimate though it was for the time and place it has led to imperial repression
B,It has led to communist repression
B,It is the father of dictatorships because of course who is the judge of the community's welfare except our bosses and they love the idea respect authority and uh if they don't have opposition as because as these majesty uh they they they lose a sight of the real individual's welfare and it therefore emphasis on community's interest exclusively is unhealthy at least to dictatorship and authoritarian rule
B,On the other side of the world the Western nations were leaven by the Pseudo Christian concept of respect for the individual
B,And from the concept of respect for the individual flowed democracy and democracy gave freedom to grow to his full height
B,And what a magnificent achievement Compare the result of the two culture
B,But let's face it excess of individualism has meant fragmentation
B,It has meant uh egoism run <unclear> word </unclear> riot
B,Uh it has meant uh uh quite unpleasant results in many parts especially in the United States which are so high so openly advertised
B,I see the picture as one where we must marry the two concepts There must be both respect for community welfare as a framework and respect for the individual and perhaps more respect for the individual than emphasis on the community's welfare
B,And frankly I I I I see this government rather uh
A,You think it's coming together here
B,There is an attempt in Singapore it's slow-moving uh it's hesitant but there's a slow-moving away from excessive community emphasis on community welfare to movement to respect for the individual
A,Yes
B,I'd like to live longer enough to see the result of this experiment maybe we can show the world how to do it
A,You feel that all the necessary ingredients are in fact in place
B,We have an intelligent government
B,We have reasonably perceptive government even if they sometime seem repressive and authoritarian they're not stupid
B,Uh they know what we're about and uh frankly it's more than a question of vote getting
B,I believe they're totally sincere in seeking our welfare
B,I mean they're integrity shows it and uh yes I think that the ingredient are here
B,The evolution may be slow but maybe a cautious approach is a wise one of quiet evolution
A,Yes yes of course one is evidently influenced by the accesses one could see in other societies where this thing has gone a little out of hand
A,But perhaps we can uh uh sort of uh uh come down to the next level or so to speak of of of uh individual freedom which is of course uhm another difficult uh area to touch on
B,Mister Iau when my friends speak about that I say tell me where are we lacking in freedom
B,What freedom are we lacking in
B,Wow they say have you become P A P
B,I said look I'm not pro P A P
B,I seek to have a sense of balance an honest balance
B,Look every time I come back to Singapore I feel like rig and wrinkle asleep for decades and suddenly I say is this Colossal City my Singapore
B,Are these vibrant dynamic people with vision and courage my fellow citizens
B,How is this happen here in forty years You know why do we have to emphasis the pimples on our face instead of looking and praising the magnificent rippling muscles of our Olympic athlete's body
B,You know I won't to refuse to kiss a beautiful woman if she has a pimple on her face
B,If I can have a government that is honest and they are honest
B,If I can have a government that's able Look around you even Benjay Ratnam will have to confess they are able
B,If I can have a government that's caring and I think it's moving that way beyond the caring for the general welfare and uh rice bowl caring for the human individual and his own weaknesses well I'm a very lucky man
B,Look I'm not perfect
B,I mean I've got sort of applying for a halo why should I expect my ministers to be perfect
B,Sure they make silly blunders
B,I mean for for me that's business about chewing gum honestly that embarrassed me acutely
B,How could they
B,How could these very able people discern to such an absurdity
B,How could you use a forty pound hammer to crack a walnut
B,Uh okay so they make mistakes they make uh blunders
B,But what is the overall picture like
B,The overall picture makes me proud to be a Singapore
B,Unfortunately the publicity is all on our the pimples on our face and I would frankly uh to have a session with our university students who complain in the dark you know uh ruthless uh whatever
B,Okay tell me where do we lack in freedom
B,We've got a declaration of human rights by by by the United Nations
B,Which paragraph have we transgressed
A,Have we violated
A,Yes <X>
