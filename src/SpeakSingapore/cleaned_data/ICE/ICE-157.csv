A,Mr Chairman Sir
A,In Singapore we do not really know the extent of the population that have disabilities
A,Using an estimate of three point eight percent used by Asian countries such as Hong Kong and Japan there are about ninety seven thousand disabled people in Singapore
A,The services for disabled people provided by the voluntary welfare organizations cater only for about eight thousand disabled people
A,The question is are we doing enough
A,There are four areas which I would like to touch on
A,Firstly a national registry of disabled persons
A,Despite the shortcomings of the previous central registry of disabled persons I believe that the ministry should set up a national registry of disabled persons
A,For this registry to succeed the referral process must be made simple and the referral sources identified
A,Sources of referrals should include hospitals school health services maternal and child health clinics polyclinics and schools
A,Without a proper database it will be difficult to project manpower needs and plan for infra-structural needs
A,By making the referral process easy and by increasing public awareness of the registry the government will be able to get a better approximation of the incidence of disabled persons and the different disabilities involved
A,This will be extremely useful for future planning
A,Secondly educational and training programs
A,Currently there are insufficient special schools
A,The vocational training in sheltered workshop programs are limited and there's a shortage of trained staff
A,What plans do the ministry have in overcoming these shortcomings
A,Thirdly national coordinating centre for the disabled
A,The ministry should work with the Singapore Council of Social Services in setting up a coordinating centre for the disabled which will employ full-time staff
A,The centre will maintain the registry coordinate the activities of all government and voluntary associations providing for the disabled and plan for future infra-structural needs
A,Lastly activities of daily living
A,To facilitate the disabled in their integration
A,I'm heartened that in many places the buildings have been designed to cater for the needs of those who are disabled
A,We can do more for example MCD should coordinate with the HDB to help disabled persons who apply for HDB flats to obtain flats that are at that
A,To obtain flats that are at the ground floor or at the same level as the lift
A,We must do more for fellow Singaporeans who are disabled
A,What plans do the ministry have in facilitating the disabled in their activities of daily living
A,Sir I would like to know the minister's views in these areas
B,Mr Yeo
C,Thank you Mr Speaker Sir
C,Sir both Mr Abdullah Tarmugi and uh Dr Michael Lim have raised questions on the disabled
C,Sir the government's policy towards the uh disabled is to help them to live independently so as in order
C,sorry is to enable them to live independently as far as it's compatible with their capabilities
C,This would enable them to look after themselves as to lessen the burden on the family
C,Sir the uh House should recall that in nineteen eighty eight an advisory council on the disabled was formed to recommend uh ways to help the disabled and to help them to integrate into society
C,The council's recommendations covered a wide spectrum of issues affecting the disabled such as prevention of disability special education accessibility and transportation social services and institutional care
C,Sir twenty six of the recommendations were adopted by the government for for implementation and these are now in the various stages of implementation
C,And would be of great help to disabled to the uh disabled
C,Sir historically the voluntary sector has been in the forefront of provision of services for the disabled
C,They have done extremely well and should be con should be encouraged to continue to do so
C,We will assist them as far as possible to provide improved and expanded ah programs
C,Now through the concerted efforts of both government and the VWOs a wide range of services and facilities have already been implemented
C,This include special education vocational training and rehabilitation vocational assessment and job placement production at sheltered workshops day-care hostels and residential care
C,Mr Tarmugi has asked in terms of what are we providing to the uh to the disabled
C,Sir we've set aside about twenty two million dollars as capital grants for the further development and upgrading of facilities for the disabled for the period nineteen ninety to nineteen ninety four
C,Twenty two million dollars over the over the five years
C,And we will also support these VWOs in their recurrent expenditures as such funding would amount to forty seven million dollars over the next three years
C,Sir we would be helping the VWOs to establish two more residential homes for the disabled one production workshop one sheltered workshop two day-activities centres one hostel and two multi-service centres
C,Some of these are already in the process of development
C,Sir in terms of the uh special education
C,For example they are already currently thirteen special education schools with enrolment of about two thousand five hundred children
C,and uh the government provides a grant of four thousand six hundred dollars per student which is twice the cost of the regular primary school education program
C,Sir Dr Michael Lim has asked some other specific uh questions also
C,He has asked that the sources that are in terms of having a referral service for the disabled
C,and that we need to set up a uh centralized referral system and registry
C,and that such the cen such a centre can then be a co-ordinating centre for the disabled
C,Sir at the present moment there's a very loose arrangement for referring disabled people for help
C,For example there are referrals uh systems whereby disabled are then referred either to the VWOs that are involved in helping the disabled
C,or they're referred to the various centres for the aged sick like for example the uh Home Nursing Foundation has a senior citizens day-care centres that also help the disabled recover from strokes for example
C,Uh we also have community day uh based day-care centres which help which uh provide help to such disabled
C,Sir the Council of Social Services will be undergoing some changes in the future and they would specific committees to focus attention on different groups of people that require help
C,So they will have a committee which will focus strictly on the disabled
C,and this group will then be able to study into what are the best ways to reach out to the uh to the disabled and what sort of help to provide to such people
C,So I think with the setting of this unit in the uh council uh in the near future would be able to have a more effective method for compiling such data
C,Sir the in terms of training programs there are training programs available for the disabled already
C,For example uh VITB already conducts training programs and uh hundred and three disabled people have been able to take part in the uh regular VITB programs
C,For those unable to take part in the VITB programs the uh VWOs do have training programs of their own
C,For example the vocational school for the handicapped uh offers training programs
C,and uh there're also uh sheltered workshops offering skills training as well as pre-employment training
C,The Singapore Council of So Social Service has also set up a centre called the Bees Link Centre which has a centralized vocational assessment service as well as a job placement centre
C,The uh the Bees Link Centre also operates a production workshop employing disabled people who have potential but who face some difficulties in getting jobs for the time being
C,So there are enough training uh places available
C,In terms of uh of the number of workshops there'll be more that'll be set up
C,Sir he's also talked about barriers to the disabled physical as well as emotional barriers
C,Sir the government together with the VWOs have been conducting educational programs and public awareness programs to raise the awareness of both the public
C,and more importantly employers in terms of providing in terms of being more sympathetic to the uh to the disabled and to offer them employment
C,The point specifically brought up by Mr Tarmugi that what the disabled are looking for are opportunities not just sympathy
C,So a there're various programs that are available to help the employment in employment of disabled people
C,The Bees Link Centre as I mentioned has the uh job placement centre
C,The centre has already placed out two hundred and twenty seven uh disabled people in uh various companies
C,There're also other schemes for example uh the there's a scheme whereby employers who are taking in disabled people are helped through a subsidy that's provided by uh that's provided by the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry
C,Under this scheme employers who employ disabled ah can have the first one and a half months salary of the disabled paid through a fund which is provided by the Chamber
C,Uh so this this way it allows the employers who are who have never had the experience of employing disabled to take in disabled for a trial period
C,And they're assured that for the first one and a half months the salaries are borne by this fund
C,We also provide tax incentives to employers who make work site modifications in order to accommodate the uh disabled
C,So in terms of direct help to employers in terms of providing training for the disabled and in terms of providing a placement service all these are already there
C,And uh I'm sure the VWOs will be looking into more ways of enhancing such programs in the future
C,In terms of physical barriers Sir
C,The government does advocate a barrier-free environment uh within the community for the uh disabled and the aged
C,This led to the government incorporating the accessibility code into the building control regulations in February nineteen ninety in order to promote a barrier-free environment
C,The government also formed a coordin coordinating committee to provide a comprehensive barrier-free environment under the Ministry of National Development
C,I think members would have noticed some of the uh decisions and programs which have been implemented as a result of this uh policy
C,You've seen the public walkways in the city for example are being modified so that ramps are provided allowing our handicapped to get on to the walkways without having to uh move up the uh the step
C,Uh now he has also mentioned about HDB flats Sir HDB has also been very supportive
C,The HDB has already formulated guidelines on uh incorporating barrier-free features in its in its estates
C,The new HDB blocks in the future will have uh provision wherever possible for improved linkages with adjoining blocks
C,There're also there'll be also more blocks where you have lift opening on every floor
C,Uh the lift lobbies would have ramps to facilitate movement of wheelchairs and the lift size would be wide enough for the wheelchair
C,So this this would help disabled who are are moving around in wheelchairs
C,Sir HDB has also uh made provisions which meets what the member has asked for
C,That is an applicant or a family member who is medically or physically handicapped will be able to uh be considered for priority allocation of a floor uh for a flat on a lower floor as well as a flat on the lift landing floor
C,So this has already been uh incorp been uh implemented already
C,Sir so I think in due course the disabled will find that moving around would be a lot easier than compared to let's say five years ago when uh more ramps are available and more uh of the barriers are are removed
C,I think I've I've replied to most of his points under the under the disabled
C,Sir I move on to the aged population
C,Both Mr Tarmugi and Dr Michael Lim have also have spoken on the aged <X>
