A,Is it
A,Wait he reminds me after the after getting the the file cover right
A,I wanted to put post cards you know of the dog and cats in it
A,Then I can't bear to lah
B,Why
A,Because once you once you stick them down to the file right then when you want to remove it next time like if you want to throw away the file and you spoil the post card you see
B,Don't stick ya
A,Then
B,Blue tac
A,Really ah

A,One was a the black and white picture of the cat and one that was very nice the Saint Bernard that one
B,But my file lei
A,Why
B,That day Elaine tried to put for me
B,Then it you know because the cover right it covers up to a certain extent and then it covers the the button because mine has got a press stud
A,Ya
B,So you cannot cannot close the file if you put the cover on top because the cover will cover over the press stud
A,Ya but why don't you do it at the at the bottom lor
B,Only for the bottom then you might as well just laminate it right
B,That means just the bottom
B,I mean just the back of the file only has one
A,Oh I see what you mean
B,You know because the thing has a flap right so when it covers the thing it there is a press stud right
A,Oh you are talking about put putting post cards or pictures there is it
B,My file can't at all because of the weird shape of the file
A,Can nah because you see you have uhm right is a file then you fold it down right
B,Ya ya
A,Then you can you can still this space here what for your pictures
B,That is where my Garfield and V C F sticker is lor
A,Oh that that means you can't put anymore lah
B,Ya
A,What what about at the back
B,At the back nice
A,Empty
A,Fine
B,Because you see I if I put it at the back I need to cover it so I will it will get very dirty
A,Oh so you oh now you have only laminated your front is it
B,I never even laminated the front
B,What I did I just put a sticker and sticker are naturally laminated already
B,I had the one with Garfield and the green coloured ode the one that Linda was saying
B,You know then the V C F sticker I just wanted to cover the National University of Singapore writing
A,Then you can laminate what
A,You put a picture at the back and then paste the <unclear> word </unclear> stick it on
B,Ma fun lah you laminate like that
A,Why you go and buy such difficult
B,But I like I am I'm used to that type of file you know
B,Since J C I had this the the one with the flap
A,That is why I hate the flap type
A,You know why
A,You can't put a lot of things in there
A,Because of then button once you if you stack it up real high right you can't close
B,Ya but isn't it the same with the others
A,No
A,The ring file we can put at least about this thick you know the stack of papers or whatever just put it there and it can still hold on to it
B,But it drops off right
A,Ya ya lah
B,Because people like me need the covering that flap right as long as the flap can close ha
B,I guaran I can guarantee that the the paper won't fall down you see
B,So I need that in case it has happened to me so many times already in the bus right and then you hold the file like that in this
A,<unclear> word </unclear>
B,Ya so embarrassing
A,You know what my friend does
A,She has you know the ordinary ring file you have this thing the
B,The clip
A,Ya the clip here right
A,Then you have the rings here right and here is where you always put your papers and sometimes when your clip is too when when too many papers to clip you can't clip everything there right
A,So what she does is that she puts the rest of the papers other side and she buys those thick clips
B,Oh
A,And she clips it there
B,Oh ya I see what you mean
A,You know what I mean
B,Oh no wonder a lot of people have those clips on their files
A,On their files quite useful ha

A,Actually you can
A,I think the cheapest is seventy but uhm for for American card holders when they send you the forms right I think they charge you one two six
