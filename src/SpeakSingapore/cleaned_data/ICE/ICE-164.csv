A,Doctor Kong when you first saw the patient on the twentieth of August nineteen ninety-one in your clinic were you aware that the Court had already declared her to be of unsound mind
B,I'm not aware of that fact
A,Were you supplied with any medical reports prepared by Doctor Ong or Woodbridge Hospital at the time when you examined
B,No at the time when I examined her I have been told that there was a doubt as to whether she was of sound mind and I then proceed to examine her
A,How long was your first interview
B,I believe it was about one and a half to two hours I think
B,We set aside two hours
B,I recall having some time left over
B,So it must have been an hour and a half or slightly more than that
A,With yourself
B,Yes I interviewed the Plaintiff's husband
A,Not just the patient alone
B,My clerk was in the room with me because I need a interpreter
A,How long you took to interview the patient alone
B,Patient alone I would say for about
A,First occasion
B,Roughly an hour I would say
A,Roughly an hour
B,Yes
A,Do you understand the Malay language doctor
B,A little
A,And how long did you interview the patient during the second interview on the fourth of September nineteen ninety-one
B,Second interview if I recall correctly
B,I think it's about forty-five minutes or so
A,Forty-five minutes
B,Yes about forty-five minutes
A,And the dialogue was also in Malay language
B,Yes I would put the question to my clerk
B,She translate it and she would respond to her
A,So you would not be able to say whether the patient's knowledge of the Malay language is good or poor
B,I passed my Standard One Malay for all that is worth
B,I don't use it very often and so my facility with it was not that great
B,But from the kind of words that my clerk was using to her I would think that her command of language was quite good
B,Better than me at least
A,You knew that she came from India to Singapore in nineteen seventy-six
B,Yes indeed
A,And you were aware that this accident took place in nineteen eighty-four
B,Yes indeed
A,In a matter of eight years the patient coming with only a knowledge of Tamil language is able to speak good Malay
A,Would it not reflect that prior to the accident her I Q must have been above average
B,I think to learn a language and master a language one need not be above average
B,Otherwise a lot of people would not be able to speak
B,I think it would be safe to say that to master a language sufficiently an I Q even a borderline I Q should be able to pick up the necessary language
B,You see that's the basis of the kind of training that are given to educationally subnormal
B,They can learn languages and use it with facility
B,You see that's the basis
B,So it does not mean that just because she can master a language she must therefore be above average
B,Then we are ruling out all the E S N's from learning any language isn't it
A,But the fact that she could pick up a new language in a new environment would show that she had good intelligence
B,I wouldn't say good intelligence
B,sufficient intelligence to learn a new language
A,You did not ward her in any hospital to observe her
B,No I did not
A,And your report is based on these two short interviews you had with her
B,Based on it
B,Interviews plus the assessment
A,Assessment reports
B,That we had made
A,Did she understand what this examination was all about
B,This was put to her at the second session and as I said
B,She did not say whether she understood or don't understand
B,So I'm not able to ascertain that point
A,Exactly your Honour
A,Now in your first interview you found her answers were vague and unspontaneous and at times appeared inconsistent
A,What impression did you gather at that moment during your first interview
B,Well I leave an open mind
B,There are many possibilities and in my trade the fact that the person has this trait could mean many things
B,There are many causes as you know for a person being vague and so forth
B,And of course as results keep coming in then one becomes slowly certain why she was vague etceteras
A,Did you observe doctor that if you asked a leading question she would easily answer yes
B,No no
A,For example if you ask her are you living at Telok Blangah
A,The answer would be yes
B,No not true
A,How was your questions put to her
B,Some of the questions we get her to describe some were leading questions
B,But I would think that the proportion would be fifty-fifty
B,In fact in psychiatric examination we are instructed that we do not ask leading questions as much as we can
B,Yes
A,And the other questions
B,Direct questions requiring a yes or no
B,And in some instances she didn't exactly give yes
B,In fact sometimes she give no
B,At the second interview do you watch T V
B,She says No
A,Did you notice any difficulty in her shifting from one topic to another
B,No difficulty
B,In fact I do it very often in my interview
B,It's a technique I have developed to pick up certain things and I move from one to the other
B,And I noticed that she was able to respond
A,You look at page one of your report doctor at the bottom
A,She was complaining to you about her body pains and despite that she was not able to point out exactly where the headache was
A,How do you explain that
B,I can't explain that
B,I put it as a statement of fact that she can't
B,You see she was describing her symptoms and all that
B,So when she stopped I said well but where's the headache
B,And then she she didn't respond
B,So I don't know what to make out of that
B,It can be due to so many reasons isn't it
A,A normal person doctor if he complains about stomach pain or headache will tend to put the hand at the abdomen or in the forehead but not so in this case
B,Not so in that yes
B,The question is why
A,Did it not strike that something was abnormal on her
B,Well something is abnormal but the question then your Honour is why would the person not respond
B,You see if you want to take the whole range you can say this is due to brain damage
B,You can take the other extreme end and you can say that this is malingering this is hysterical
B,It's a whole range you see
B,So I refuse to commit myself
B,I put it as a statement of fact
A,You are aware that she had an injury to her frontal lobe
B,Indeed
B,This was what she said as well or her husband said to the
A,No I'm talking about the patient
A,Forget about the husband for the time being because your interview is restricted to the patient
A,Did she complain to you anything else apart from the bodily pains
A,What did she complain of
B,She complained of headaches her head bursting giddiness a lot of symptoms in relation to the head
A,And did you conduct any test for her memory
B,Yes my psychologist did the Graham Kendall's Memory for Design Test which showed eleven which is borderline up to about twenty-five is considered borderline
B,I think roundabout seven is considered borderline
B,So she I would say she get quite a high score
B,The lower the score the normal it is
B,The higher the score the more abnormal it is
B,So we didn't arrange a borderline from say seven to about twenty-four
B,She score about eleven which I think is quite good
B,Obviously she has definite memory deficits but her memory deficits strike me on the testing as mild
B,It's considered borderline
A,But she had some difficulty performing the task
A,She was slow
B,Yes she was slow which my psychologist document
B,You can read that in his report
A,Now did you find out what was her attitude towards her children
B,I did ask her about her children and she says she's quite happy with the children
B,And she said that they were good to her
B,So I put her a direct question
B,So are you therefore happy with them
B,She just kind of again stared blankly
A,No answer
B,No answer
B,So she doesn't answer yes to direct questions that's one and two
B,Her response again would indicate a wide variety of conditions
B,So I feel that it's I would put it down as a matter of fact rather than comment on it
A,Did you also observe that in one moment she would say something and the next moment she'll forget
B,Not all the time
A,But were there instances of such
B,There were perhaps one or two instances when she would behave like that
B,Again the significance of this behaviour like with this is open to question
B,It can be argued
A,For example doctor you said that you were asking about the children and finally you put a question to her
A,And the answer is negative
B,Yes
A,How would you explain to that condition
B,Well as I said there are many different explanations from that
B,It can be due to depression
B,It can be due to brain damage
B,Can be due to malingering or hysteria
B,Whatever one can put to it you see
B,There's a whole range of explanations
B,For instance when I asked her how many legs a dog has and she don't respond for a minute
B,I thought that she won't say anything
B,So I was very pleasantly surprised when she says four
B,I'm glad I waited
B,Had I been impatient I would have lost that
B,So I'm not sure whether in fact you know one can say it's due to brain damage
B,I mean the causes of such responses such behavioural responses are many
B,And at this point in time I want just to describe what actually happened and state it there
A,Did you discuss with her about what plan she has for her family her sons
B,We tried to but she doesn't want to consider that
A,There was no response
B,Well she showed by her demeanour that she doesn't want to respond to it
A,In such circumstances doctor
A,Do you think that she would be able to live independently
B,I think again it's very hard to say
B,Why would a person not be interested to discuss the future
B,I think again one can think of a variety of causes that can cause a person to act and behave in that way
B,And I do not want to straitjacket myself and say it is due to this one thing or put it down first and let's consider what other possible causes
A,Do you think that she'll be able to lead an independent life
B,I think so because in my view I am increasingly convinced looking at Doctor Ong's report that a lot of it all could be due to phobic anxiety
B,And a large degree I think to a depression that probably I hesitate to say this
B,But I think it's probably inadequately treated
A,Suppose you give her a ten dollar note doctor and ask her to go down to the market just below her apartment and do the daily marketing for the day
A,Do you think she'll be able to carry out that function
B,Well Doctor Ong says that she could handle small amount of money in one of his earlier reports
B,If that's the case I would expect that if we can overcome the phobia and get her out of the home
B,On the basis of what Doctor Ong said
B,I would say yes
A,But at this moment do you think she would be able to <X>
B,At this moment a lot of motives will contaminate the behaviour isn't it
B,Motives of tranquil
