A,On AM Singapore this morning what Australia looks for in President Bush's visit Singapore Australia tie up with an arts and food business during the holidays
A,Hello I'm Zainal Abidin
A,President George Bush arrives in Australia today the first stop of his twelve day trip to the Asia Pacific countries which includes Singapore South Korea and finally Japan
A,<unclear> word </unclear> was the mission he meant to be a good move visit is now said to be more of a trade mission with creations of jobs for Americans at home as his primary target
A,To the countries he's visiting he carries the firm message that free trade is a two way street
A,By this he hopes to gain greater access for US goods and services into booming Asia Pacific economists
A,The message is primarily aimed at the Japanese with whom US has a trade deficit of forty billion US dollars and seventy five percent of which is attributed to the high export of Japanese cars into the United States without reciprocal openness by the Japanese automobile market
A,But during his talk in Australia the top issue on the agenda is likely to be America's defence commitment in the region
A,But is this the only concern of the Australians
A,With some insight into the Australian's view of the matter I'm joined on the line now by political correspondent in Australia Mike <unclear> word </unclear>
A,Good morning Mike
A,Yes uhm so will regional defence or regional security be Australia's key concern uh during Bush's visit there
A,No what are the specific trade issues that will be raised by Australia
A,So what do Australians generally feel about Bush's call for a free trade and greater access for US goods in the Asia Pacific market
A,Now something has has it that US agricultural surplus with Australia goods into a very high figure of about about one billion dollars actually but will be Australia's request on on this matter to the US for this
A,Now you know since the whole matter concerns the farmers do you expect the farmers to go on a demonstration to show their displeasure of uh US agricultural subsidies policy
A,Uhm uh now with a with reference to the defence uh commitment of the US in the region what do you think uh would be Australia's uh particular expectations of Bush's trip
A,Well thank you Mike for joining us this morning
A,Political correspondent Mike <unclear> word </unclear> of Melbourne <unclear> word </unclear> on the line from Canberra
A,A corporation of the artistic kind between Singapore and Nanyang Ac Academy of Fine Arts with an Australian university will give art enthusiasts the opportunity to get their fine arts degree locally
A,In the past getting a degree in the fine arts often meant studying in a foreign country
A,This prospect will now change
A,Students can now pursue a degree course at the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts under a joint campus arrangement with Curtin University in Australia
A,Starting July nineteen ninety two the academy will be adding another year to its normal three-year diploma course
A,Students taking this additional year will be eligible for a degree awarded by Curtin University
A,But what's the advantage of having a paper qualification in a field such as the fine arts where it's the work that counts a question Shanji Dabaracharji put the academy's President Dr Gwee Ee Hian
B,The work of course comes in most importantly in fact it's also based on the work that they will be awarded degrees
B,Also when an employer employs an artist he will look at the work rather than at the paper you have so you are quite right in that regard
B,But on the other hand uh there is a tendency in Singapore as elsewhere for people who have completed tertiary education to receive that degree as a sort of a benchmark of their uh educational uh uh progress you know
B,So I think there's no reason why people in art and in design you see should be deprived of that opportunity and be on par with others who study the traditional disciplines
B,I think the satisfaction to the people who are in this area is also very important
C,So it's basically a self-satisfaction in getting a degree uhm that's the main purpose of going for this uhm this course offered by Curtin
B,I think it's more than that
B,It's also recognition that your work you see has also reached a standard which is on par with other university studies
C,Well you talk about standards uh I understand that Curtin university will be determining the academic syllabus for this course but how will the local Asian flavour be retained in this course because you seeing how Curtin is an Australian university
B,Oh the uh development of the curriculum for this fourth year will be done in fact jointly
B,The uh students will be taught by us and therefore the Asian flavour would still be retained and for the theoretical studies I think a little bit of uh Australia input you see in fact would be very very useful but the bulk of the teaching being done in Singapore by our own staff and the environment is such we are pretty sure you see that the fourth year as far as the style as the content go you see will be a continuation of the first three years where the students were trained by us
C,So there will be some retention of the local Asian flavour even if they even if the degree is conferred by Curtin university
B,Uh I think it will be more than retention
B,The local flavour will be there in fact that's one aspect where Curtin is very interested
B,They also want to see that uh our work here would also have some influence on their home students in Australia later on
B,It's a two-way exchange
C,It's a two way exchange so what exactly will our students be learning from Curtin university
C,If it is uh will it be basically style technique
B,Uh style technique yes but I think they would also inject a stronger element of theoretical studies than what uh we have been accustomed to
C,Could you get elaborated than that
B,I think uh the training in NAFA had been studio-based so uh the Australians would probably come in and provide uh academic studies like psychology of art history of art aesthetics and so on and also they will bring in some Australian influence and background which will interact with our Nanyang influence to create something that is even more interesting than you know what we have been doing on our own
A,Dr Gwee Ee Hian uh Principal of the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts
A,You've just tuned in you're listening to AM Singapore and coming up next how the food business is faring during this festive season
A,Fancy dining on the top of the world feasting on juicy lobsters delicate ascagoes and popping champagne to welcome in the nineteen ninety two at midnight tonight
A,Well sounds infinitely tempting doesn't it
A,Well if you're willing to splurge a whopping a hundred and eighty eight dollars on fine wine and exquisite cuisines then treat yourself
A,But for most other Singaporeans the traditional New Year's Eve dinner tonight may be a less elaborate affair but an affair nonetheless
A,Singaporeans may not have shopped as much this Christmas on New Year's season because of expected economic slowdown as recent reports suggest but the feasting and partying seems as feverish as ever
A,In fact when Tan Yong Meng made a check with three major local hotels all reported an increase in sales volume in their food and beverage outlets <unclear> word </unclear> executive assistant food and beverage manager of Hyatt <unclear> word </unclear>
A,Eric Golding manager of Goodwood Park said the hotel also registered an increase in business this Christmas
A,Daniel Chia director of operation at SMI hospitality services which manages the Pinacle attributes the better sales this year to more sensitive pricing strategies
D,Well compared to last year surprisingly there has been an improvement of about five percent
D,Uh I said surprisingly because uh when I took a walk around around the uhm shopping centres there appeared to be uh a lack of uh activity compared to past years festive season
D,It is our new pricing strategy that has uh enabled us uh to reach out uh much more patrons
D,Since October we have a pricing package which allows the patrons to choose three four or five courses uh on a run of the menu basis at uh a minimum of sixty two dollars plus plus
D,I believe that this is the uh main factor which uh motivated people to come to the Pinacle
D,<unclear> word </unclear> of Hyatt
D,One of the hotels' main strategies in filling restaurant seats is direct selling to an identified segment of the market
D,One food chain that did experience a slowdown in business this festive season is the Tung Loke group of restaurants its managing director Andrew Chew
E,It is satisfactory in general but uh we do experience a drop in sales in uh some of our restaurants but this ah could be due to uh more rainy days this month than uncertainty about the future of the economy
A,Andrew Chew expects harder times ahead especially when Singaporeans tightens their belt in economic slowdown
A,To make things worse he expects keener competition from new restaurants expect to to open next year
A,Eating is a national hobby but most Singaporeans eat out less especially when one needs to dig deep into one's pocket in leaner times
A,The three hotels that Tan Yong Meng talked to weren't too concerned about the prospects of a slowdown
A,So the heartier your <unclear> word </unclear> appetite is next year the more mouth mouth-watering the takings will be for hotels and restaurants
A,In the meantime if you're planning on dining out at some pricy joints tonight it's fine wine glorious food and wise company to usher in the new year bonapetit and a very happy and profitable new year
A,And on that festive note we end this morning's edition of AM Singapore
A,We'll be back again tomorrow morning to bring you more stories behind the headlines on New Year's Day
A,Until tomorrow then on behalf of producer Tan Yong Meng this is Zainal Abidin wishing you a relaxing holiday </I>
F,Christopher good evening
G,Good evening David
F,Welcome to Moneymind
F,Well we've seen the market already take a fall and comeback intraday we've seen it stop at seventeen twenty-one
F,Is this the correction and do you still think that we could test seventeen hundred
G,Uhm it is part of the correction but I still think we can test seventeen hundred uh though of course uhm since realism has been built into the market uhm a lot of the bad news if you like is now being discounted in the market
G,You see you must understand David that much of what has been attributed to us uhm I think hasn't been probably over exaggerated
G,The main argument that we have been putting is that the market moves on perception and many people had been concerned about overheating in China so Hong Kong has they've been taking money out of uh they have seen the Malaysian second and third liners go through the roof so they're weary there and well basically most <unclear> word </unclear> investors have been losing money in Thailand so they know there've been a problem in the Bangkok market
G,But they see Singapore as being terribly safe and and I think that's the principle concern
F,Okay when you made this prediction you looked at certain indicators
F,Would you like to take us through some of this
G,Yes I'll like to take you two very si simple ones
G,The first one is our leading indicator for the economy
G,As you can see there on the yellow line uhm the economic indicator is suggesting as least one if not two quarters of week GDP growth
G,Now I'm not saying that there's going to be a fall out but the point is that many international and local investors had assumed no uh uhm hiccups in GDP growth and consequently you know this small problem
G,The second is the timing problem <X>
G,We are expecting the market to improve very dramatically but as shown in this second chart which has earnings versus the market
G,Now the yellow line is the market changes and the red line is the earnings change
G,As you can see there is actually a very strong correlation between the two
G,Theory suggests that the market does anticipate changes in earnings as we can see in 1981 and 82
G,Now in 1983 and 84 the market over-anticipated and was pulled down
